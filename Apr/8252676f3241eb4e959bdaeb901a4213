Elaborating, she told the political parties present in the meeting to focus on discussions that align to the present political situation in the country, economy and the country’s environment as well. “The function of many political parties is to see what is going on and to give opinions to the government and our task is to engage you in those issues. I promise to engage you," she said. Equally, she said her government is determined to ensure that by 2025, the country economy gets back to its middle-class economy which was attained in 2020 and lost it recently due to various crises.
