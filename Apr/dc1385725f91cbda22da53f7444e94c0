AFTER being reinstated as Coastal Union Head Coach, Juma Mgunda will face defending champions Simba in their 19th NBC Premier League fixture at Mkwakwani Stadium in Tanga on Thursday. Recently, the club’s management announced that Mgunda, who was trading as the team’s Technical Director will now be in charge of the team throughout the remainder of the season. He takes over from then Head Coach Melis Medo who was sent packing following series of unconvincing results after starting the season on a gas pedal. From 18 played matches, the Tanga giants are placed 11th on the ladder with 21 points, which is not a comfortable slot hence they need to produce a chain of wins in their upcoming encounters to remain confident on the log. Facing Simba will definitely be another difficult test for them to pass after losing their previous home match 3-1 to Ruvu Shooting which added salt to the fresh wound for them. In general, the going has been bumpy for Mgunda’s side as they are dropping crucial points in most of their league matches and it remains a crossword puzzle as to whether they will be able to downsize Simba on the day. This is the moment when they need to put on serious face and aim to clinch as many points as possible bearing in mind that the marathon towards the championship is slowly reaching to its climax. Last season, the Tanga based side survived relegation scare after recording an aggregate 5-3 win over Pamba in a two-legged playoff fixture as such; they hardly want to repeat the same scenario this term. A loss on the day could have seen them relegated to the Championship league where the fight for premier league promotion is always very tense.
