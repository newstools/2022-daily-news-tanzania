The UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) says that more than five million people have fled Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion on February 24. More than half of those who have left, about 2.8 million, fled to Poland. An estimated seven million people have also been displaced within Ukraine amid Moscow’s offensive.
