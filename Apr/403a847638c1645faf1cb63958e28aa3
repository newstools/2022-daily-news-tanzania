THE government said on Wednesday that three renewable energy projects in Singida Region will be completed between 2023 and 2027. Deputy Minister for Energy Stephen Byabato said in Parliament on Wednesday that the government has been working to establish several generation projects in the country, including a wind power project in the Singida Region, through Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) implemented by private investors. Mr Byabato was responding to a basic question from Special Seats MP Jesca Kishoa, who wanted to know when the Singida Wind Power Project would start construction. “These projects include a 50 MW wind project implemented by Upepo Energy Company in Msikii area Singida Rural Council, where negotiations for a Power Purchase Agreement between them and TANESCO are ongoing," he said. He added, "Other projects include a 300 MW wind project implemented by GEO Wind Company in Kititimo area Singida Urban, where negotiations between investor and donor Green Climate Fund (GCF) are ongoing; and a 100 MW wind project implemented by TANESCO in a joint venture with Abu-Dhabi (Masdar) company in Ikungi District Council where a feasibility study is underway,". “Implementation of these projects is expected to be completed between 2023 and 2027,” he said In her follow-up question, Ms Kishoa inquired about the progress of talks between the government and the Exim Bank of China for a loan to implement the projects. The deputy minister responded by saying that these projects are carried out by private investors, that the government promotes an investment atmosphere, and that an investor must then find a sponsor who will invest in the project and then sell the generated electricity to TANESCO. "GEO Wind has been hunting for donors for a long time, and they finally found one in the Green Climate Fund, who is in the process of finishing the talks and is ready to invest," he said. Mr Byabato stated that the government has previously prepared guidelines in the preparation for the investor receiving funding and beginning the project.
