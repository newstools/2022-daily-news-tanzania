NICOL Investment Plc’s newly directors will be endorsed at the special Annual General Meeting (AGM) at the end of this month in Dar es Salaam. The Company’s Acting Chief Executive Officer, Mr Erasto Ngamilaga said in an interview in Dar es Salaam recently that the decision to increase the number of directors was made during the 7th AGM in December last year. “The law requires a special AGM where shareholders can endorse by votes the newly appointed directors. We want the company to continue to be competitive, effective and efficient in the wake of growing competition in different sectors of the country’s economy,” he said. He noted the special AGM will be held physically and online for those who will be not able to attend and the agenda is to endorse new directors. He said they have decided to retain directors who have good experience and vision to uplift the company’s profile. Furthermore, he said NICOL has continued to do better on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) whereby the shares prices have increased from 170/- in 2021 up to 580/- in April this year. According to the acting CEO, NICOL has diversified its investments in profitable projects and has invested 15bn/-in government treasury bills. He said also that NICOL has managed to cut the cost resulting in an increase in profit after tax to 4bn/-. In their AGM held November last year, NICOL shareholders endorsed a dividend worth 1.047bn/-for the year that ended 2021.
