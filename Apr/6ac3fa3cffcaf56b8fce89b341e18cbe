The issuance opened on 7th January offering 25bn/-, the offer attracted 74.2bn/- from applicants equivalent to a subscription rate of 297 per cent. The oversubscription is a good indicator of capital market vibrancy in Tanzania, in the sense that the market has good absorption capacity to accommodate large debt issuances. Furthermore the recent Treasury bond coupon reduction will make the market more interested in corporate debt issues since they are benchmarked above government securities. We expect to see more corporate bond issues within the year. Debt Primary Market Wednesday 20 April 2022, the Bank of Tanzania offered 1.0bn/- for the 35-day maturity Treasury bill while 1.7bn/- was offered for the 91-day bill, it also offered 3.0bn/- and 72.7bn/- for 182-day and 364-day maturities respectively. All the bills on offer where subscribed, consequently the weighted average yields for all bills dropped as demand for the money market instruments increased. The 364-day bill yield fell from 3.62 per cent recorded in the last auction to 3.19 per cent loosing 43 basis points, the 182-day bill lost 9 basis points to reach 3.32 per cent from 3.41 per cent, 91 day bill lost 19 basis points to 2.65 per cent from 2.79 per cent and the 35 day bill lost 15 basis points from 2.5 per cent to 2.35 per cent. Secondary Market In the trading week ending April 22, the yields on government securities slightly dropped. The new 20 year Treasury bond with revised coupon began trading this week registering yields similar to previously issued bonds. Activities in the secondary market were bearish, in line with our forecast, the value of bonds traded decreased sharply by 63.41 per cent to 25.06bn/- from 68.5bn/- recorded in the previous week. Registering a mere 32 trades relative to 48 trades in the preceding trading week. Reduced trading activities are attributed to the market gradually adjusting to the new introduced treasury bonds. Next week the Bank of Tanzania will auction a 7-year treasury bond, we expect the auction to register a low subscription rate as it has been the case for medium term bonds, Outlook Domestic listed equities have begun releasing their audited financials for 2021. As we anticipated, recovery from Covid-19 pandemic and the overall economic growth pulsates a number of companies to higher profitability. We expect more companies to follow suit resulting to increased trading activities in quarter two. In the fixed income market, money market yields continue to fall as the 1-year Treasury bill printed out an average yield of 3.19 per cent representing the lowest in over a year. We expect to see as similar trend in the coming auctions.
