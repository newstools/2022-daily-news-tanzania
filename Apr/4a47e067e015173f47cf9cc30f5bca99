During his recent tour in Kagera Region, the Minister for Livestock and Fisheries Development, DrMashimbaNdaki explained that the livestock sector plays a key role in the nation’s economy, calling for concerted efforts from all stakeholders, including the private sector. “The private sector plays a key role in the country’s ambition to achieve industrialization. Authorities in the local governments should work closely and assist the private sector including investors in the livestock sector,” he said. He assured small-scale livestock investors who fulfilled the requirement and had already paid the levies would be allowed to sign a contract for five years instead of the current one year.
