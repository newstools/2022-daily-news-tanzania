ABSA Bank Tanzania has pledged to come up with new products to help penetrate the unbanked population and drive up financial inclusion. Speaking during an Iftar dinner hosted for the bank's customers in Zanzibar over the weekend, Absa's Head of Business Banking, Melvin Saprapasen said they were confident about the future as they continue to innovate and come up with new products and solutions that are more digitalised that make it easier for our clients to access and enjoy our services.” He pointed out the year 2021 had been a very good one from the financial performance perspective as the Bank was able to recover from a reported loss of 532m/-in 2020 to register 9.4bn/- profit after tax in 2021. “During the year the bank also launched an SME lending product and improved its digital transactional banking channel as part of product and customer segments expansion and digital offering improvements,” he said. He said the public sector support participation improved significantly in 2021 as the Bank's role to contribute more positively to the socio-economic development of Tanzania continues to gather more pace. The Bank’s Head of Retail Banking, Ndabu Lilian Swere said during the year 2021, the bank launched some innovative product diversifications, including a retail mobile lending product in partnership with Tigo Tanzania that has reached thousands of customers and assisted them to access financial services more conveniently and improve their lives and wellbeing. Ms Ndabu noted that the bank has a well-established tradition of hosting an Iftar dinner each year as part of its policy to shove back to reciprocate customer loyalty, adding that the bank focused on providing services to small, medium and large customers, including working with government and local and international agencies. The bank continues to have a strong capital position and operates well above regulatory and internal capital requirements. On his part, Sheikh Khalid Ali Mfaume, who represented the chief Mufti of Zanzibar in the event commended Absa for the gesture, alluding to one of the tales of Prophet Mohammad that, “he who feeds a fasting believer is  repaid  the equivalent of all the blessings of those hosted,”
