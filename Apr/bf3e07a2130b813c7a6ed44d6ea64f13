Ukraine hopes to evacuate 6,000 people from the besieged city of Mariupol via humanitarian corridors on Wednesday. However, the mayor, who has left Mariupol, says that there are still about 100,000 people left in the city. Vadym Boichenko also warned that the agreement with Russia was only preliminary. If it holds, it will be the first on creating safe corridors since 5 March. That agreement collapsed, and many people have been trapped in Mariupol for weeks without running water, power or other supplies. It's a strategic target for Russia because it's a south-eastern port for Ukraine. Russia claims to control most of it, with the last Ukrainian defenders holed-up in the vast steelworks.
