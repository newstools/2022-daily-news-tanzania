Western leaders are set announce a further set of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday, the US has said. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the measures will target Russian financial and state-owned bodies, as well as some officials and oligarchs. Ms Psaki said the move will "hold accountable the Russian kleptocracy that funds and supports Putin's war". Calls for further sanctions have grown in recent days amid allegations of Russian atrocities in Bucha. The town's mayor told the BBC on Tuesday night that Russian forces had killed around 320 civilians during their occupation of the town, while the discovery of mass graves has caused outage in western capitals. Ms Psaki told reporters during a news conference in Washington DC on Tuesday that the sanctions, which are expected to include a ban on all new investment in Russia, will "degrade key instruments of Russian state power, impose acute and immediate economic harm on Russia".
