More than 600 companies are now known to have chosen to halt or reduce their work in Russia following the invasion of Ukraine in February - according to US-based academics. The Yale University team has tracked the responses of more than 1,000 big businesses. It says despite many withdrawals, a number of Western firms are continuing their work as normal. In their frequently-updated list, they've given 'grades' to each company based on how far it's curtailed its work. Firms from Heineken to Netflix have been awarded an A for halting Russian engagements. On the other hand, the likes of Emirates Airlines and JD.com are given an F for pursuing "business as usual".
