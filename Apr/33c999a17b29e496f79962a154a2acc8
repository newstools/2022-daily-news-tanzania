THE founder and president of the African Women in Leadership Organisation, Dr Elisha Attai has said his recent visit to Ngorongoro Crater was indeed a life experience, saying the crater was an awesome wonder of God. Speaking shortly after concluding his tour of Tanzania on Saturday, Dr Attai said he has visited many exciting places in world but he has never seen nature in full display like in Ngorongoro. “I have visited many exciting places around the world, but I have never seen nature in full display like how it is in Ngorongoro,” he said, adding that Arusha Tanzania was a real deal. He said Ngorongoro Crater has vast population of wildlife ranging from the big five -- lions, elephants, leopards, buffaloes and black rhinos. He said the wonders at Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania signify that Africa was truly gifted and blessed with abundance of wanders. He called on women in leadership to start planning to attend the African Women in Leadership Summit in August 2023 to witness what he said was Tanzania's unique formation of gender parity ratio and exceptional tourism attractions. The African Women in Leadership Organisation (AWLO) has singled out Tanzania to host next year's women in leadership summit citing impressive gender parity ratio that affords Tanzania to be one of the countries with more women in high ranking positions. “You have a woman president, a woman speaker of the Parliament, woman foreign Minister and many other women cabinet ministers what else you need," he said. He said the world needs to come and learn to Tanzania on formation that accommodates women in leadership. The woman in leadership summit is expected to be held at Arusha International Conference Centre (AICC).
