SERENGETI Girls striker Clara Luvanga is the leading scorer in the U-17 Women World Cup campaign whose finals will be staged in India in October this year. According to the records issued by the Confederation of African Football (CAF), the brave Tanzanian girl has scored seven goals in the three games her team has played. Clara netted a brace when Serengeti Girls beat Botswana at Amaan Stadium before adding a hat-trick in the return leg in Francistown in Botswana. The gifted scorer scored her second brace in the third match pitting Serengeti Girls against Burundi in Ngozi last week. The second in a hunt for the tournament’s golden boot is Djennah Cherif from Morocco who has netted four goals while Tanzanians; Neema Paul and Aisha Juma, have each netted three goals. Other players with three goals are Fatoumata Samoura from Guinea, Opeyemi Ajakaye of Nigeria and Zouhir Yasmine from Morocco. However, Clara Luvanga will miss an opportunity to score more goals when Serengeti Girls host Burundi at Amaan Stadium on May 1st this year due to yellow-card suspension. Serengeti Girls have pitched a camp at Amaan Stadium here for an intensive training ahead of the return leg match with Burundi early next month. The fourth round stage is almost achieved for Serengeti Girls after their 4-0 away victory similar to Nigeria who handed Egypt a 4-0 drub. Morocco who pulverised Niger with 11-0 drub in the first leg are sure of a place in the round four. Ghana who beat Guinea 3-0 in the first leg are also poised to see the fourth round. If Serengeti Girls eliminate Burundi they will meet the winner of a match between Cameroon and Zambia. Cameroon defeated Zambia 2-0 at home last weekend. Three teams will represent Africa in the U-17 Women World Cup whose finals will be staged in India from October 11th to 30th this year.
