Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) national chairperson, Samia Suluhu Hassan has said swift changes within the ruling party are inevitable as it strives to conform to global political trends. Samia, who doubles as President of United Republic of Tanzania, made the statement at Jakaya Kikwete hall in Dodoma Friday adding that changes are important for the country’s oldest party to cope with global political pace. Amid ongoing party’s reforms taking place within the CCM, President Samia told members that: “I promise to lead this party…build the party.” At Friday’s extraordinary meeting held in the capital city, CCM congress members endorsed minor constitutional changes, which the chairperson described as a boost for efficiency in the organisation’s decision making process. Other reasons for the reform, according to the Chairperson, were to enable the party to get strong and competent leaders who will be able to discharge their duties diligently, fostering implementation of CCM manifesto as well as fighting against corruption and abuse of power.
