British multinational banking and financial services provider, Standard Chartered recently announced that it is planning to exit 7 markets in Africa and the Middle East region. The markets include 5 countries in Africa and 2 in the Middle East. Standard Chartered has decided to exit Angola, Cameroon, Gambia, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe. In addition, the financial services provider aims to leave the markets of Jordan and Lebanon. Additionally, in two African markets (Tanzania and Cote d’Ivoire), Standard Chartered is planning to focus solely on its Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking ('CCIB') business. Additionally, Standard Chartered has highlighted its significant investments in Africa and the Middle East during the past few years. The financial giant recently opened a branch in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. “As we set out earlier in the year, we are sharpening our focus on the most significant opportunities for growth while also simplifying our business. We remain excited by a number of opportunities we see in the AME region, as illustrated by our new markets, but remain disciplined in our assessment of where we can deliver significantly improved shareholder returns,” the CEO of Standard Chartered Group, Bill Winters, commented. In February 2022, Standard Chartered announced the expansion of business banking and digital strategy with the appointment of new global heads. Xie Wen joined Standard Chartered as Global Head of Business Banking while Mohamed Keraine became a part of the bank to drive its digital agenda. Source: financemagnates
