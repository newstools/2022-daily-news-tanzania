Police in Sweden say they have arrested at least 26 people in the wake of weekend clashes in the cities of Norrkoping and Linkoping against the planned burning of the holy Quran by a far-right group, with at least three injured in police firing in Norrkoping. Eight people were arrested in Norrkoping and 18 others were held in Linkoping, police said in a statement on Monday, adding that protesters in Norrkoping numbering about 150 threw stones at officers and set cars on fire. “Police fired several warning shots. Three people seem to have been hit by ricochets and are now being cared for in hospital,” police said about Norrkoping, adding none of the injuries was life-threatening. “All three injured are arrested on suspicion of crime.” On Sunday, clashes erupted in both cities for the second time in four days over rallies by anti-immigration and anti-Islam group Hard Line, led by the Danish-Swedish politician Rasmus Paludan.
