THE Economic and Social Research Foundation (ESRF) has asked the government to come up with more friendly laws to nurture startups. The advice was given on Sunday  in Dar es Salaam by the Economic and Social Research Foundation (ESRF) Principal Research associate, Prof Samwel Wangwe during the launch of a report on a comparative baseline study on establishing a startup policy in Tanzania piloted by the Tanzania Startup Association (TSA). Prof Wangwe said specific policies and legislation should be structured for startups which will set standards and procedures that must be followed by all stakeholders but also create a mechanism to nurture the startup. He said that the law should have a clear provision on the definition of startups to avoid overlapping and multiplicity of roles and functions. He said also that the law should have a general provision on the entitlement of tax incentives for startups with specific incentives provided under the Finance Act. Prof said the Commission of Science and Technology (COSTECH) Act 1986 was amended to ensure there are provisions in the framework of administration and coordination of the startup's ecosystem. On his part, the Netherland Ambassador to Tanzania, Mr Wiebe de Boer said that the embassy has been working closely with the TSA to strengthen the entrepreneurial ecosystem particularly to support creating a business-friendly environment for startups to flourish and to attract national and foreign investment. An official with the Ministry of Investment, Industry and Trade Permanent Secretary, Dr Hashil Abdallah said the government is working hard to ensure that the country's current economic development improves. On his part, TSA Board of Directors Vice Chairperson, Lulu Ng’wanakilala thanked the government and partners who were involved in the preparation of the report.
