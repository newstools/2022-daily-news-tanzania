At least 30 people have been killed during two days of attacks by gunmen in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Red Cross says. It happened in Ituri province, which along with neighbouring North Kivu, are under an official state of siege in effort by the government to stop the attacks by dozens of armed groups. The attacks are thought to have been carried out by the Allied Democratic Front (ADF), one of the deadliest rebel groups operating in the region. They were brutal - some of the victims had been found tied up - others had had their throats slit. Homes were torched and property looted. In December, more than 1,000 Ugandan soldiers crossed into DR Congo for what was meant to be a joint military operation to defeat the ADF. But despite promises of progress, the group has continued to carry out frequent attacks on vulnerable communities. In North Kivu, another rebel group called M23 has recently relaunched a rebellion seizing villages adding to the security crisis.
