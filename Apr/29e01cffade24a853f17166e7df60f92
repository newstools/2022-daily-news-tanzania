Former Guinean Prime Minister Ibrahima Kassory and three ex-cabinet members are due to face embezzlement charges before a court in Conakry following their arrest last week. Mr Kassory, former Defence Minister Mohamed Diane, ex-Environment Minister Oye Guilavogui and former Hydrocarbons Minister Zakaria Coulibaly will appear at the Court of Repression of Economic and Financial Offences (Crief) on Monday. They were detained on on Wednesday last week on charges of embezzling public funds after three days of questioning. Mr Kassory served as prime minister from 2018 until President Alpha Condé was overthrown in a military coup last September. The ruling junta has pledged to fight corruption and not launch a witch-hunt against prominent figures in the deposed regime. In March, the authorities demolished the home of former Prime Minister Cellou Diallo after accusing him of building houses on public land.
