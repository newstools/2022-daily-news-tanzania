Footballers, celebrities and social media influencers will be banned from gambling adverts under new rules. From October, gambling companies will not be allowed to use stars to target under-18s, The Committee for Advertising Practice said. Anyone with a "strong appeal" for young people, such as footballer Cristiano Ronaldo and Love Island star Chris Hughes, must not appear in the adverts. The body representing betting firms said it welcomed the new rules. Michael Dugher, chief executive of the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC) said the changes built on industry-led measures designed to "drive up standards and ensure further protections in advertising." The Committee for Advertising Practice (CAP) said the "tough" new rules were part of its commitment to safeguarding young people and vulnerable audiences. The new rules state that gambling and lottery ads must not "be likely to be of strong appeal to children or young persons, especially by reflecting or being associated with youth culture." References to video game content and gameplay popular with under-18s are also against the new rules. There is opposition to gambling advertising amongst some politicians, parents and groups that campaign for awareness around gambling addiction. Former England and Arsenal footballer Paul Merson, who became addicted to gambling himself, last month told BBC Sport it "sickens" him to see former players and managers in gambling adverts. Earlier this year, Paddy Power launched a tongue-in-cheek ad featuring former Arsenal and West Ham player Jack Wilshere. Former Tottenham Hotspur manager and I'm a Celebrity winner Harry Redknapp has previously appeared in ads for Betvictor. And former Love Island contestant Chris Hughes is a brand ambassador for Coral Racing.
