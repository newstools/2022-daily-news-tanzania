Barrick North Mara Mine has taken advantage of the ongoing Occupational Safety and Health at workplace exhibition in Dodoma Region by providing fire-fighting education to institutions and various community groups, and as well donating some fire-fighting equipment. The Head of the Mine's Occupational Health and Safety Unit, Dr Nicholas Mboya, said the company, through its experts, is committed to ensuring that it delivers this education by visiting the target audience in their respective areas instead of waiting for them to visit the exhibition pavilion. He said since the start of the exhibition they have already visited and provided education and distribution of equipment to the Police’s Field Force Unit, heavy-duty truck drivers and ‘bodaboda’ riders, adding that they have also visited public entertainment venues, markets, secondary schools and colleges. "Our team is organized, there are staffs who educate the public about the operation of Twiga and Barrick activities in the country in our pavilion and others provide safety education and fire control in the community", said Dr Mboya. On their part, some of the institutions that visited and provided fire control education and received fire equipment donations have thanked Barrick Company for disseminating this education to the community. The Dodoma Field Force Unit Head, ACP AnaniaAmo, thanked Barrick after receiving the fire-fighting equipment and first aid kit. “We thank you to visiting us, giving us education and equipment especially within this period when fire hazards are occurring more often”, said ACP Amo. The Manager of Bambalaga Bar, Philipina Focus, also thanked for the equipment donation and fire control education and called on security experts to conduct such type of training for the public as most of them, despite having fire control equipment, just keep them as decoration because they can’t operate them.
