GEITA Gold's prolific striker George Mpole believes he is capable of adding more goals that will enable him to win the golden boot at the end of the season. Speaking to the ‘Daily News’, Mpole said he will work hard with his team mates and the technical bench to achieve his goal. Mpole, the former Mbeya City and Kimondo player, has so far netted nine goals, two inferior to the leading scorer, Fiston Mayele of Yanga who has netted 11 and Namungo’s Reliant Lusajo with 10 goals. Yanga’s Said Ntibazonkiza and Meddie Kagere of Simba, have each netted six goals each. Jeremiah Juma of Tanzania Prisons and Police Tanzania’s Vitalis Mayanga have each netted five goals. Mpole said he believes there are still a lot of matches before the end of the season and that he still needs to keep scoring to help his team. "I know the leading goal scorer Mayele has eleven goals but not a lot of goals and if you look at this competition it has become very hard and highly competitive, '' ‘’ He said. Commenting about George Mpole's performance, Geita Gold assistant coach Mathias Wandiba said Mpole is a disciplined player who respects everyone in the club. He said they will cooperate with Mpole so as to make him achieve his goal of becoming the top scorer. In the Premier League standings, Geita Gold are placed sixth with 24 points after playing 19 games. The team has won six, drawn six and lost seven matches. Geita Gold will play their three home matches of the Premier League against KMC, Azam and Kagera Sugar.
