TANGA’Ss Small Industries Development Organisation (SIDO) in collaboration with UK-based Tools for Self-Reliance (TFSR) has trained 750 youths in sewing machine repair persons. The youths from 150 groups of small entrepreneurs in Tanga and some from Arusha, benefited from the programme recently after organising realising there is a great number of abandoned sewing machines due to a lack of repair persons. Tanga’s SIDO Training Coordinator Ms Gladness Foya said recently that the training was designed to solve sewing machine repairing a problem after breaking down and become an expensive experience for tailors since they either buy new ones or stay out of business for a long period. “This is the second phase of the training for the project which was attended by participants from eight districts of Tanga as well as other participants from the Arusha,” she said. During the training, the participants managed to refurbish six sewing machines and repair three others. The training facilitator, Mr Gibson Shenkalwa, said TFSR had conducted research and found out that many sewing machines are left unused due to a lack of technicians to repair them. "Many of the sewing machines have been checked and are possible to repair them instead of throwing them away and buying new ones,” he said. SIDO Tanga acting Regional Manager, Liberatus Macha, said they will continue to help artisans to improve and modernise their work and grow into large enterprises that help to reduce the unemployment problem. Mr Macha said that SIDO has mentored some small entrepreneurs through technical support since its establishment some 50 years ago. He said that some of them have developed into big industrialists. TFSR is an international development charity that recycles and refurbishes tools and sewing machines and supplies them to partners in Africa in conjunction with training programmes. The main recipient countries are Tanzania, Uganda, Ghana, Zambia, Sierra Leone and Malawi.
