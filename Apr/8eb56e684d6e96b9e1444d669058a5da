Pakistan's president has dissolved parliament and called early elections following a parliamentary attempt to remove PM Imran Khan from office. It comes after parliament's deputy speaker refused to hold a vote of no-confidence the PM was expected to lose. Mr Khan claims the US is leading a conspiracy to remove him because of his criticism of US policy and other foreign policy decisions he has taken. Opposition politicians ridicule the allegation, and the US has denied it. Imran Khan visited Moscow to meet President Vladimir Putin as Russia was launching the invasion of Ukraine, He has previously criticised America's "War on Terror". The BBC's Secunder Kermani says prime minister is widely regarded as having come to power with the help of Pakistan's army, but now observers say they have fallen out.
