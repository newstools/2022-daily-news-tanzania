DTB continue to lose their supremacy in the Championship race after hefty lead was reduced to three points at the top of the table with five games to play before the league climax. Their recent 2-2 draw with Fountain Gate has the title race towards the Premier League promotion wide open, thus anticipating anything to happen on the way. DTB, who are based in Dar es Salaam, have accumulated 56 points from 25 games, meaning the remaining five games of the race are going to rule who really deserve the premiership ticket. The outcome was rather a relief to the second-placed Ihefu, who recorded a slim 1-0 win over Mashujaa to keep their hopes of returning to the top flight league alive. All 16-teams in the Championship have played 25 games and the battle is tense among the top three sides; DTB, Ihefu and Kitayosce as they have equal chances to grab the Championship League title. Kitayosce who sit on third slot, also have 53 points similarly to the second-placed Ihefu and the duo are causing sleepless nights to DTB bearing in mind that any drop of points will see them dethroned from the top spot. Mashujaa, who accommodate the fourth place with 39 points, have a 15-point gap to cover before finding the third placed Kitayosce. As such; it remains a three-horse run for the league’s promotion and it should be known that the teams at the top are the ones which invested heavily in their respective squads. If DTB manage to climb into the Premier League, then possibly, Dar es Salaam will have five representatives in the senior league. Four teams; Young Africans, Simba, Azam and KMC are currently playing in top flight league.
