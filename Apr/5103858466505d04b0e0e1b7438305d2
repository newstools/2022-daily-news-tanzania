VICE-PRESIDENT Philip Mpango has implored clerics in the country to avoid intrareligious conflicts caused by the struggle for leadership and power abuse. Dr Mpango stated this during an iftar on Wednesday prepared by Dar es Salaam Regional Peace Committee. At the event held at Karimjee Hall in the city, the VP stressed that religious leaders must greatly pray for peace to prevail in worship houses, since conflicts are against religious teachings. The VP also ordered the Regional Commissioners countrywide to ensure they strengthen peace committees in their respective areas, including holding regular meetings with the committees. “Such committees have been very helpful in building understanding between lead ers and believers of different faiths, heightening communication between religious leaders as well as campaigning for peace among all Tanzanians,” he argued. He also asked the clerics to use this Holy Month of Ramadan and the Lenten season to continue praying for the nation and its leaders so that peace and tranquility could be maintained for the country to attain development. Dr Mpango further urged them to focus on teaching good morals in the public in efforts to curb evil acts including gender-related violence that have increasingly been reported in recent days. On his part, Chief Sheikh Mufti Abubakar Zubeir bin Ali stressed that religious leaders will continue prioritising peace in the country and called on Tanzanians to safeguard peace at all costs. Earlier, the Committee’s Secretary, Bishop Jackson Sosthenes, said the committee has continued to cooperate well with the government in supervising good morals by campaigning against evil acts such as corruption, illegal drugs and human trafficking. He affirmed that the committee is well prepared to cooperate with the government to ensure successful execution of the National Population and Housing Census slated for August 23, this year.
