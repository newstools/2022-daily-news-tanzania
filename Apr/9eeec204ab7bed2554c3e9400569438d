PRESIDENT's Office Regional Administration Local Government (PORALG) has instructed Tanga region to follow procedures for establishment of other areas of administration, including establishing a new region. Deputy Minister for the docket, Dr Festo Dugange made the statement in Parliament when responding to a question from Mlalo MP Rashid Shangazi, who sought to know when the government will divide Tanga region. The lawmaker was concerned that Tanga has a huge area of administration and that dividing it will ease delivery of social services to the public. Responding, the deputy minister said the ministry is yet to receive proposals for dividing Tanga into two regions. He said the procedure for establishing new regions, districts and divisions has been indicated in the Regions and Districts Establishment Procedure Act, Cap 397, R.E. 2020. "It has also been indicated in the guidelines for establishment of new administration areas of the year 2014," he said. He said in the preliminary procedures for establishment of new administrative areas, the law requires public engagements from village level. "There must be engagement of villagers, ward development committees, council meetings, District Consultative Councils (DCC) and Regional Consultative Committee (RCC)," he said. Adding; "After completion of this procedure at regional level, then the applications are submitted to PORALG for assessment on whether the set criteria have been met," noted the deputy minister. Moreover, Dr Dugange also asked authorities in Uyui District, Tabora region to follow the same procedures if they want to establish a new council in Igalula. This was in response to a   question by Igalula MP Daudi Venant (CCM) who asked when the government will form the Igalula council. Like Mr Shangazi, the Igalula lawmaker was concerned of the large size of Uyui district council, suggesting a need to form another council in Igalula.
