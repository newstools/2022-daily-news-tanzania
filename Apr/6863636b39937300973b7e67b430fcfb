PRESIDENT Samia Suluhu Hassan is expected to officiate the much awaited May Day, which will be marked at the national level in Dodoma region as public servants remain on highest expectations to have pay rise as pledged by the president last year. Addressing hundreds of workers at CCM Kirumba Stadium in Mwanza region, President Samia said that at that time, her government was not in the right position to raise salaries, citing economic factors. However, she promised to raise salaries in the following year's May Day which comes next month. On that day, the President reduced Pay as You Earn (PAYE) from 9 per cent to 8 per cent. on Thursday, Dodoma Regional Commissioner, Anthony Mtaka said this year’s May Day would be one of its own as he launched a hashtag for the celebrations that will be marked in the country’s capital and the political region of the country. The hashtag: ‘Meimosi2022dodomakivingine’ seeks to engage every worker in the country to be active ahead, during and after the celebrations. For the first time, the Dodoma Regional Commissioner said over 3,000 delegates, who will arrive in the country’s capital, will optionally have an opportunity to have a glimpse on the development projects currently being undertaken in the city after the newly launched Projects Tourism. The Mtaka-designed projects tourism seeks to ensure that every person entering the region knows what is actually going on in making the country’s Capital greater and one of its own in the East, Central and Southern African regions. At a news conference, Mr Mtaka said ahead of May 1, 2022, there would be a series of activities including sports and exhibitions to be conducted by different workers unions and the private sector as well as other stakeholders in the working sector. The RC said this was yet another opportunity for business persons in Dodoma to tap the opportunity, as many persons were now coming to their areas.
