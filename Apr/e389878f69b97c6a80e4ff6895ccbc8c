THE Minister for Investment, Industry and Trade Dr Ashatu Kijaji has expressed optimism on President Samia Suluhu Hassan’s visit to the US, saying it will address trade volume between the two countries. Dr Kijaji, who was speaking at a virtual meeting ahead of the Royal Tour documentary premiering, oozed confidence that the visit would restore confidence among US investors as Tanzania seeks to restore business and economic ties with the rest of the world. “There was a significant drop in trade volume between the two countries in the recent past, we hope that the visit will greatly address that,” said the Minister. According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, in 2019, Tanzania was 121st largest goods trading partner to the US with 462 million US dollars in total (two way) goods trade. US goods exports to Tanzania in 2019 were 333 million US dollars, up 0.2 per cent from 2018 and up 110.5 per cent from 2009. The top export categories (2-digit HS) in 2019 were: aircraft (175 million US dollars), machinery (27 million US dollars), cereals (wheat) (23 million US dollars), plastics (19 million US dollars), and milling products (9 million US dollars). US total exports of agricultural products to Tanzania totaled 47 million US dollars in 2019. Leading domestic export categories include: wheat (23 million US dollars), prepared food (3 million US dollars), pulses (3 million US dollars), vegetable oils (ex soybean) (3 million US dollars), and poultry meat & products (ex eggs) (2 million US dollars). Likewise, Tanzania was the United States' 119th largest supplier of goods imports in 2019. US goods imports from Tanzania totaled $130 million in 2019, up 34.2 per cent ($33 million) from 2018, and up 162.7 per cent from 2009. The top import categories (2-digit HS) in 2019 were: precious metal and stone (other stones, not strung) (41 million US dollars), knit apparel (29 million US dollars), woven apparel (23 million US dollars), coffee, tea & spice (10 million US dollars) and vegetable saps and extracts (6 million US dollars). US total imports of agricultural products from Tanzania totaled 24 million US dollars in 2019. Leading categories include: unroasted coffee (9 million US dollars), cocoa beans (2 million US dollars), planting seeds (2 million US dollars), tree nuts (1 million US dollars), and spices (321 thousand US dollars). US goods imports from Tanzania totaled 130 million US dollars in 2019, up 34.2 per cent from 2018, and up 162.7 per cent from 2009. The US goods trade surplus with Tanzania was 203 million in 2019. US-Tanzania Trade Facts show that the US goods trade surplus with Tanzania was 203 million US dollars in 2019, a 13.8 per cent decrease (33 million) over 2018. US foreign direct investment (FDI) in Tanzania (stock) was 1.5 billion US dollars in 2019, a 5.2 per cent increase from 2018, while Tanzania's FDI in the United States (stock) was 1 million US dollars in 2019, unchanged from 2018. “The president is single-handedly promoting investment and trade in the world and she’s in a special way restoring confidence in US investors to the country,” she explained. Dr Kijaji admitted that Tanzania’s business environment had received its fair share of criticism from investors, saying the president was well on course to reverse the situation. Dr Kijaji said the launch of the much-awaited documentary was the tip of the iceberg, hinting that the country would witness an influx of investors from the US after the high-profile visit. With inflation in the price of food products witnessed around the world following the war between Russian and Ukraine, Dr Kijaji rallied farmers to put emphasis on producing more wheat for exportation. President Samia’s trip to the US is estimated to generate 1 billion US dollars in investments. Such investments will contribute to major economic growth to Tanzania, but in a way also contribute to economic growth and jobs in the United States as well. The visit to the White House in Washington DC comes exactly 60 years after Tanzania’s founding Father Julius Nyerere visited President John F Kennedy in 1962.
