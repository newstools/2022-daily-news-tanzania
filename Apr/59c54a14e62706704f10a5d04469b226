Equally, Ms Mhagama informed the House that the government will also prioritise enhancing supervision of human and financial resources by emphasizing inclusive responsibilities. According to her, the government will also continue to make sectoral reforms for improved output. In another development, the minister said in the financial year 2021/22, the government through Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) conducted verification of beneficiaries in 186 authorities. She said, a total of 886,724 households were verified where 781,342 of them qualified to continue being in the second phase of the scheme, adding: “The remaining 105,382 households have recorded positive economic progress, hence ready to graduate from the scheme.” Commenting on the budget estimates for the ministry, Members of the Parliament asked the government to come up with a special strategy that tackles the chronic shortage of civil servants in different professions. The legislators expressed a concern that despite the importance of public service, they are faced with a serious shortage of servants in almost all the crucial areas.  A Special Seats MP, Ester Bulaya (Chadema) said the demand for public servants in the country is too high. She cited an example of Bunda Town Council, which according to her, is facing a shortage of over 900 civil servants. She said, Bunda has a total of 38 local government executives while the demand is 80, the demand for primary school teachers stood at 1,252 but there are only 738 teachers. The lawmaker said the council requires 48 extension officers, but there are 34 only. There are 184 health workers in Bunda against the requirement of 402 professionals. “We have a serious shortage of science and mathematics teachers; the requirement is 162, but we have 68 teachers only,” she stated. For his part the  Member of Parliament for Ubungo constituency, Prof Kitila Mkumbo (CCM) said, since the public services is an engine for implementation of government policies, laws and national development plans, then there is a need  to ensure sufficient numbers of officers in all the areas. He explained that the public service sector faces a number of challenges but the most critical is shortage of civil servants. “The demand for primary and secondary school teachers in the country is 433,992, but there are only 258,291 teachers,” noted the MP adding that the gap in the education sector stands at 175,701 which is equivalent to 40 per cent. “The health sector has a total of 98,987 servants against the requirement of 208,232 health workers, a shortage of 109,295 estimated as 52.5 per cent,” he stated. “The shortage of workers in the health sector affects provision of services at our dispensaries and health centres where more than 70 per cent of the population receives medical treatment,” he said, adding the demand for health professionals at health centres is 131,547, but there are only 48,579. Prof Mkumbo also spoke of agriculture, which is one of the crucial productive sectors, saying it requires a total of 20,000 extension officers, but there are only 6,600 of them. The gap for the mentioned sectors is over 1.2 million. “We need a strategy to tackle the shortage of workers especially in crucial areas; the 30,000 workers to be employed in the coming fiscal year is too small compared to the requirements,” he explained. However, he advised the government to continue creating a good environment for the private sector to facilitate establishment of more private schools, which will employ teachers. He said only three per cent of the schools in the country are privately owned. On her part, Special Seats MP, Leah Komanya urged the government to prioritise allocating newly employed servants to districts with serious shortage.
