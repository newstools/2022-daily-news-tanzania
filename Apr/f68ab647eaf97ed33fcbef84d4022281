On the other hand, SWALA was the top loser contracting by 40 spreads to close at TZS 450 per share, in an unexpected way this was the counter’s first price movement in over 2 years. About 40,000 shares were enough to push the counter’s price down. Furthermore, NICOL and CRDB also dipped by 3.28% and 2.63% respectively each closing at TZS 590 and 370 per share respectively.

Treasury Securities The central bank on behalf of the government, issued a new 20-year bond, carrying the new coupon rate of 12.1% down from the 15.45% coupon. The issue carried an offer of TZS 129.8Bln ($56.4Mln) to which the public tendered TZS 175.1Bln ($76.13Mln) about a 35% oversubscription rate. Albeit the auction was oversubscribed the tender size has significantly shrunk from the usual amounts the public has been tendering recently. We suspect the decline could be due to the deteriorating yields to the bonds and the downward revising of the rates just fueled the fire. The market is likely to see this trend in the rest of the long-term bonds. The successful amount stood at TZS 95.57Bln ($ 41.55Mln) which is significantly lower than the offered amount. The yield to Maturity for the 20-year paper now stands at 11.6%. Money Markets The Interbank cash market (IBCM) volume transacted has improved slightly from TZS 45Bln of the previous week to TZS 6402Bln that transacted on the current week on review. Despite the improvement in the amount transacted the interbank rate slightly declined to 1.56% down from 1.86% of the previous week. The transactions on the interbank cash market have remained minimal given the sufficient liquidity in the banking sector. The Interbank currency market remained relatively stable during the week under review. Neither the exchange rate nor the volume transacted changed much from the previous week’s recorded volume. This week the market transacted a total of 7.05Mln the same as the previous week. The TZS/ USD exchange increased by about 10pips to 2,310.12 from TZS 2,310.02 of the previous week.
