The Parliamentary Standing Committee for Industry, Trade and Environment has promised to address the challenges facing the steel industry to promote an industrialized Tanzania. The Committee made the commitment recently during a tour of Alaf Limited and MMI Steel which are the leading steel manufacturers in the country mostly through their renowned SimbaDumu and Kiboko iron sheets respectively. The Committee Chairman, David Kihenzile said this was one of their regular activities, which is also a learning tour for the members of his committee so they get a clear understanding of the steel industry. “We have through this tour picked up issues that are affecting this industry as presented by Alaf and MMI Steel and as a committee, we agree that all these are valid concerns that need quick action,” he said. He said some of the challenges presented include importation of sub-standard finished products, losing competitiveness against other EAC countries, under-valued importation of finished products, importers calling themselves ‘manufacturers’, delay in VAT refunds, counterfeit products in the market and the impact of Covid 19. According to the Chairman, his committee will see ways to advise the government to ensure fair competition in the country. The Alaf Tanzania Chief Executive Officer Ashish Mystry said the Committee’s visitation was quite significant and shows government commitment toward the manufacturing industry. “I am sure this committee will help us find solutions to the challenges that the steel industry is facing,” he said. The MMI Steel Executive Director, Patel Veer said they are committed to expansion as long as the government helps to overcome the current challenges facing the steel industry. “The level of investment is huge and we need the government to come in handy and protect us against these substandard imports and this can be done by raising the import duty,” he said.
