ZANZIBAR President, Dr Hussein Mwinyi has emphasized the need for collaboration to strengthening the Government of National Unity (GNU) for the interest of all Zanzibaris. He made the remarks at the State House in Zanzibar on Monday in a meeting with the recently elected national Chairman of the ACT-Wazalendo, Juma Duni Haji, who paid him a courtesy call, according to a statement issued by Statehouse Communications Directorate. “We need to work together for the interest of the people,” said Dr Mwinyi, as he congratulated the new ACT-Wazalendo National Chairman for being elected to hold the party’s top post, the statement said. Dr Mwinyi said meeting and holding talks was a good way to strengthen the GNU formed by the ruling CCM and ACT-Wazalendo after the 2020 general election. Mr Duni said it was a fruitful meeting and thanked President Mwinyi for welcoming his delegation at the State House for talks, in which they discussed various issues on the future of Zanzibar. “President Mwinyi has welcomed dialogues on different issues, which is good for our country. Instead of complaining at public rallies, we have to solve our differences through dialogues,” Mr Duni said. He also lauded President Mwinyi for promoting unity among Zanzibaris. "It was a fruitful meeting and we have to work closely. Dr Mwinyi has also promised to work on what they agreed with the late Maalim Seif Sharif Hamad- Founder of GNU as we all have a desire to build our country,” said the new ACT-Wazalendo Chairman. Mr Duni said he would urge party members to promote constructive politics and avoid hate speech, so that people remain united for the interest of Tanzania.
