INVESTIGATIONS are underway after fishermen at Bwejuu coastal village in Unguja South Region found unattended speed boat, partly submerged upside down in the Indian Ocean. According to an eyewitness, about four fishermen, while fishing, saw a capsized boat capsized and dragged it to the shores. Members of the security and defence forces led by officers from the Tanzania People’s Defence Forces (TPDF) were swiftly deployed to inspect the boat. “So far it is safe, but after we complete investigations, we will give details,” Mr Rashid Hadid Rashid- Regional Commissioner said. He said that the investigations include finding out whether it is the speed boat reported stolen in Mauritius several weeks ago. Mr Rajab Ali Rajab from the Zanzibar Maritime Authority (ZMA) said they were communicating with authorities in Mauritius to get more details about the boat. It was reported early this year that authorities in Mauritius were looking for a speedboat stolen in Baie-Baie. The speed boat, equipped with two engines of 300 horsepower each and belonging to the Fishing Company was in the lagoon. Fishermen led by Hakim Kombo have requested the Zanzibar authorities that the boat remains under their control until it is proved that it was from Mauritius. “If it happens that there is a reward for finding the boat, we should be given the priority,” Kombo said.
