THE Head coach of the Mwanza-based Women's Premier League side, Alliance Girls, Sultan Juma has promised to organise well his squad to enable it perform well in in the next league season. Juma made the remarks on Tuirsday in the exclusive interview at Nyamagana Stadium saying the just ended season was very tough for his side. "Actually this season was not very good for us. We played in the league despite fighting so hard we have not been able to achieve our goal. Now we will plan to do well next season to win among top positions," he said. Adding, he said his team went through a very difficult situation unlike in their last four league seasons when they had a stellar performance. Juma said the infancy of his squad as well as lack of experienced players, have contributed to his team’s poor show in many league games. He strongly has urged football fans in Mwanza to continue supporting their team so that they can do well in the league. "This season we were building our youthful team whose majority players are very young and most of them still studying," he added. He promised to recruit players who are very talented and competitive so as to help their team shine next season. Alliance Girls have finished sixth with 32 points after playing 22 games. The team has won nine, drawn five and lost eight matches. They have netted 28 and conceded 27 goals.
