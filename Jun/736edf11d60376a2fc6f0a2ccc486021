The spike in global food prices is "a direct consequence" of the war in Ukraine - and not, as Moscow has asserted, the consequence of sanctions on Russia - says Nato's chief. "Export of food and grain from Ukraine is extremely critical," Jens Stoltenberg tells reporters in Brussels. "The spike in food and grain prices shows global ramifications of this war." "Russia tries to create narrative that spike in grain prices is caused by our sanctions - that's not correct." The secretary-general says international efforts are ongoing to try and lift the Russian blockade of Black Sea ports to allow the export of Ukrainian grain - with Turkey a key player in the negotiations He adds: "There are some efforts to get some grain out over land - Nato countries are involved in that". Earlier this week UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet warned of a sharp increase in global food insecurity as the war in Ukraine continues.
