Cristiano Ronaldo has been named Manchester United's Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year in his first season back at the club. In his first spell at United, Ronaldo won the coveted award in three campaigns - 2003/04, 2006/07 and 2007/08. After an impressive return to Old Trafford, fans have voted for the Portuguese icon to receive the trophy, now presented by @adidasfootball, for a record-equalling fourth time. David De Gea is the only other Red to have claimed a quartet of Sir Matt Busby statuettes. Supporters all around the world took part in the online poll across ManUtd.com and the Manchester United App - thanks to everyone who voted. CREDIT: https://www.manutd.com/
