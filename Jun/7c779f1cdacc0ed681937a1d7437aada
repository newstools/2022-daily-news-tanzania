THE Dodoma Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr Anthony Mtaka has urged the Police Force to establish police zones in the capital as efforts to deal with emerging youth gangs popularly known as ‘panya road’ in the region. The RC made the remarks at a rally held recently at Kisasa area, following reported incidents of theft, armed robbery, and murder of some innocent civilians in various parts of the Dodoma region. He said that criminal incidents have been reported in some streets such as Kisasa, Chang’ombe, and Nkuhungu thus there was a need for establishing police zones in the areas to deal with the criminals. The RC declared war with the gangs and all people engaging in criminal activities calling upon the public in the region to cooperate with police in exposing them. “I assure you that no criminal will remain in Dodoma, if someone breaks down people’s doors, we will not accept that stupidity, we are well organized to deal with them,” he echoed. In another development, RC Mtaka has urged parents to build a culture of monitoring their children because some of them have been ending in engaging in evil activities. Mr Mtaka called on citizens who are capable of installing CCTV in their compound, and business complexes to collaborate so as to fix the security system in their areas. Dodoma Regional Police Commander Martin Otieno urged that there is a need for involving community in monitoring youth movements to prevent crimes in the region.
