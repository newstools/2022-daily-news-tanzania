DEBT Primary Market The Central bank was in the market on June 8, 2022 offering 123bn/- to investors through issuing a new 15-year treasury bond. The auction under-subscribed, unconventional for the 15 year Treasury bond, however we see the low subscription rate of 73 per cent attributed to the effects of the reduced coupon rates. We mentioned in our previous special report that the reduction of coupons will slightly deter investors from primary auctions, we foresee this being the case for the near future. Low participation will mean yields will slightly edge higher due to absence of aggressive pricings in auctions. Total amount tendered was 90.33bn/-, the minimum successful price printed at 98 as the central bank rejected aggressive bids priced at low discounts. Average yield to maturity for the auction stood at 11.26 per cent. With the introduction of new issues, we expect the yield curve to adjust upwards in the mid to long end, as old bond yields converge with new ones. Secondary Market In the trading week ending June 10, the yields on government securities in the secondary market remained relatively unchanged, however the 15-year bond registered a slight uptick, following the primary auction result of the new 15 year bond having a slight price effect on the respective bonds in the secondary market. Activities in the secondary market were vibrant, tenures traded included 7,10,15,20 and 25. Number of trades doubled from 26 trades recorded in the previous trading week to 55 trades in the trading week ending June 10. Furthermore, value of bonds traded increased by 71.33 per cent to 52.24bn/- from 30.49bn/ recorded in the previous week. June 15, the Bank of Tanzania will be auctioning treasury bills, we expect yields to slightly register a downtick. Outlook Equities As we have previously highlighted, in the ex-div period that the market is in, stocks will slightly register a downside albeit this fall in price is not due to company fundamentals or the general outlook of the equity market, rather a reflection of ex-dividend period that the market is currently in. Counter such as CRDB, TPCC and NMB have registered a slight fall in price of -5 per cent, -5 per cent and -2 per cent respectively. However, we are going to see a slight upside post ex-div, subject of course to each companies results for quarter 2 of 2022.
