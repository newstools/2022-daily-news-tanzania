ZAMBIA’s long distance coach Royal Africa Luxury has launched its maiden voyage from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania to Johannesburg in South Africa opening doors for travelers to now opt for land surface means of transport from the expensive air transport. The 3,412 route is anticipated to take over 50 hours, or some four days and a half. Gregor Lumato, the bus driver, told reporters in Dar es Salaam shortly after stopping at the John Magufuli bus terminal in Mbezi that the new safari is a link between Southern African Development Community (SADC) member states. It is not clear how the new route would address the influx of illegal immigrate especially from Ethiopia, South Sudan and Eritrea who have been frequently on the authorities radar as they illegally try their way into South Africa. The bus had spent 20 hours from Kitwe in Zambia to Magufuli’s terminal. Officials said the bus will depart Kitwe every Saturday and stop in Dar es Salaam and will take off on Tuesdays. Daily News couldn’t immediately get the bus fare for every country, along the trip.
