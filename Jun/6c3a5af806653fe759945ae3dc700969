The UN secretary general's special representative in Democratic Republic of Congo says "a strong military response" is needed to end the M23 insurgency "once and for all". Bintou Keita praised the UN forces and the national army for restoring calm in Nyiragongo and Rutshuru areas of North Kivu province after two weeks of clashes with the rebels. Speaking on Wednesday from the province’s capital, Goma, the Guinean diplomat said ending the threat from the rebels was possible with: The M23 has called for the government to implement the Nairobi peace accords of 2013, but the government now regards them as "terrorists" and has ruled out new talks with them. In recent clashes with the group, 16 soldiers were killed and two peacekeepers injured, according to the UN. Nearly 100,000 civilians fled the fighting last week, but began returning to their homes earlier this week after M23 announced a retreat from areas it had captured. The UN has more than 15,000 troops - the largest globally - deployed to stabilise the volatile region of eastern DR Congo, home to more than 100 rebel groups. After more than 20 years, it has been widely criticised for having failed in its mission to protect civilians from militias.
