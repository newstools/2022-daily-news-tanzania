TANZANIA Catholic Women (Wawata) organisation has been urged to educate the public on the importance of the upcoming National Population and Housing Census slated for August 23, this year. Assistant Parish Priest for Kagondo, in Muleba District, Fr Leodigard Mwesiga made the call over the weekend during the commemoration of 50 years since Wawata’s inception in 1972. “Women play a key role in the society…it is very important for each of you to promote the National Census. We want every citizen to take it seriously. You are family pillars and the church depends on you to fulfill this noble task,” he said. He urged them to continue cooperating with their personnel on collecting information without fear, adding: “The results of these researches are important pillars for the government in its efforts to bring development to its people. The information collected will be kept strictly confidential and will be used for statistical purposes only,” he said. According to the 2012 Population and Housing Census projections Kagera Region’s population currently stood at 3.2 million. Elaborating, Fr Mwesiga said the Population and Housing census is the total process of collecting, classifying, evaluating, analyzing and publishing or distribution of statistical data related on housing and their residents in the country during a certain period of time, The 2022 census will be the sixth in the series. Other census took place in 1967, 1978, 1988, 2002 and 2012. Equally, he urged women to raise their children in good moral and ensure that they are not exposed to gender violence, adding that education is one of the child’s rights, thus while in school children should report any abuse that may lead to denial of such right. “We must also take action to address the problem of loitering and engaging in excessive drinking habits, especially the youths, but instead concentrate on hard work,” he remarked.
