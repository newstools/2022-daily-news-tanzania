A TOTAL of 20bn/- has been saved in an ongoing verification of compensation claims from people in Tarime District who were reallocated to pave the way for North Mara Gold mine operations. A state valuer, Rashid Mageta said over the weekend that the amount of money saved were from 5,000 people who lodged false claims. He said land speculators had developed areas after a government notice of prohibition issued on May, 2020. “Some people from Komarera village in Tarime District build houses, churches and others planted trees even after the government notice of prohibition to develop their areas,” he said. He said 6,847 people whose claims are genuine from the evaluation exercise will be paid 26bn/-. "So far 2,058 people have been paid 8.9bn/- and that payment is ongoing," said Mr Mageta. “The genuine claims will be compensated but the false ones will be dropped. Satellite pictures show all that was located there when the ban was announced to stop making any development in the area.” The government valuer stressed that all the buildings built after the notice would be demolished. The Chairman of the Komarera Village Government, Nyamaganya Marwa, has admitted that some of the people have been found planting trees in the area violating the government notice which was issued in accordance with the law. "Those people who are committing such acts now are at fault, we have already prevented them that for doing so it is outside procedure," Marwa said. The government valuer said among the factors to consider when the mine investors need a new area for mining activities is mobilisation which also involves the district commissioner. He said that speculation business starts immediately after reports leaking that mining investors want more area for mining operations. “The aim of evaluation and paying compensation is to relocate indigenous people but part of the money is being paid to speculators who run away after getting payment,” said Mageta.
