IN efforts to prevent water borne diseases and reduce the cost of buying drinking water, the Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology (DIT) has come up with a technology that will help the public to get clean and safe water. Speaking at the ongoing National Council for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (NACTVET) exhibitions at the Jamhuri Stadium, an innovator Mr Asaad Mohamed said the Go-Safe water purifier   will help to prevent various water related illnesses. The Go-Safe water purifier which uses electricity, solar and water pressure can clean water from the tap with mud, salt, dust among others water borne diseases after fixing it with the machine. He said the technology is ideal in rural areas, schools and other social services centres where people will get drinking water directly from the tap once the system is installed. "We want to support the government efforts to ensure that many people have access to clean and safe water thus having a society  that is free from water borne diseases  thus  engaging  effectively in  economic activities" he said. Mr Mohamed said the innovation was among the 86 picked by the judges during the National Competition of Science, Technology and Innovation (MAKISATU) held in Dodoma last month. He said plans are to open up centres especially in remote areas to sell water at affordable prices as their strategy to serve the communities for the better in ensuring the country attains the United Nations goals of increasing access to clean and safe water. Moreover, he said, in collaboration with private and public institutions they will sell the water purifiers at affordable prices so as to increase access to clean and safe water He called upon nongovernmental organisations taking up clean and safe water projects to join hands and go for the technology as a solution to majorities.
