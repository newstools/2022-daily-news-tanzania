TANZANIA Bureau of Standards (TBS) and Fair Competition Commission (FCC) have warned business people to stop dealing with substandard goods in the market as stern legal measures will be taken against them. The TBS Director General Dr Yusuf Ngenya and FCC Director General William Erio made the remarks at the weekend when talking about the claims of increased substandard goods particularly on electricity in the market. Dr Ngenya said integrity should be an important virtue that business people in the country are required to cultivate in order to do business smoothly. “TBS has the obligation to ensure that importers and manufacturers bring to the market high quality goods that meet the required standards and reflect the value for money,” he said. He said TBS has been undertaking various campaigns to create awareness to business people and consumers on how to identify substandard goods. Dr Ngenya said TBS works closely with FCC and other institutions to make sure that consumers get high quality goods. He said TBS is continuing with awareness campaigns but if the business people will not stop importing substandard goods, the standard watchdog will change modality of inspecting imported goods. On his part, the FCC Director General Mr Erio warned manufacturers to abide to country’s quality standards because making low quality goods would make them face legal measures. “When importers bring into the country substandard goods, may face penalties between 10m/- to 50m/- or a penalty equivalent to the value of the goods imported,” he said adding that the culprit may also be sentenced between five to 15 years in jail. Mr Erio urged Tanzanians to buy goods from registered shops to avoid incurring losses for using low quality products.
