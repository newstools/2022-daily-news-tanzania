THE Government is creating good environment to ensure opportunities available in blue economy benefit citizens. This was declared in Dar es Salaam by Zanzibar Minister for Blue Economy and Fisheries, Mr Suleiman Makame, when he was closing the two-day international blue economy conference organized by Dar es Salaam Maritime Institute (DMI). He said if Tanzanians will make efforts to tap blue economy opportunities for their economic development, the money they would be getting will be circulating in our economy. “For a longtime we have witnessed many foreign vessels conducting fishing activities in our deep see, they come and take our resources and we remained as observers. I think this is not good trend, we have to reorganize ourselves and start fishing in deep sea because I believe we are able to do it,” he said He urged the DMI management to improve their curriculum to accommodate seafarers’ profession because the government expects to receive many fishing vessels, thus need qualified experts for fishing activities in deep see. The minister said three months ago the government received ship which will be used for fishing in deep see so there was a need to train more fisheries experts who will be used in the sector instead of being too dependent on foreign fishing experts . “Am not a seafarer but I have been close to many of them for a very long time so I know majority of them are not specialized in fishing because majority of them are ship engineers and ship captains so I urge DMI management to put curriculum that will accommodate seafarers to specialize in fishing so that we can have our own experts,” he said The Minister said Tanzanians have not used effectively different opportunities available in deep sea and instead they depend much in hand to mouth fishing which does not help them to increase their incomes and improve their lives. “We in Zanzibar have started to organize ourselves to go to fish in deep sea and you are supposed to do the same because you have been issuing fishing permit to foreign ships for a very long time so it is high time for you to take chance and go deep see for fishing. We must change this trend like what we did in minerals,” said minister On her side, the DMI Acting Principle, Dr Tumaini Gurumo, said for many years the college has been training seafarers who are not fishers adding that they will improve their curriculum to accommodate seafarers who will specialize in fishing .
