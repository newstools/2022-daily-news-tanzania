ERENGETI Girls have been packed in group D of the upcoming 2022 FIFA Under-17 Women’s World Cup finals set to kickoff on October 11th to 30th in India. The country’s envoys will compete against Japan, Canada and France which are also members of group D and the best two top teams will make it into the quarterfinals of the contest. The brave girls are making their debut appearance at the world cup stage with full backing from the government and all Tanzanians who are hopeful that the team will do wonders. Even president Samia Suluhu Hassan congratulated the representatives after earning qualification for the event and has already wished them all the best. Serengeti Girls cruised into the world cup finals courtesy of a 5-1 aggregate win against Cameroon which was enough to drive them further to where they are now as they are set to dine on the same pitch with other qualified teams from across the world. Under the tutelage of Head Coach Bakari Shime, the team has been stamping tangible results in most of its assignments and there is no doubt that the same rhythm they applied during qualifiers will be used at the finals. Africa has deployed three envoys which are Tanzania, Nigeria and Morocco with each looking sharp to achieve great success and possibly bring the glittering trophy into the continent. The trio managed to do well in their qualifying matches and will try to use the competition as a platform to sell real talents which is bestowed among African players and perhaps they could earn a chance to be signed outside the continent for professional football. Nigeria are placed in group B together with Germany, Chile and New Zealand while Morocco are squeezed in group A together with the hosting side India, USA and Brazil.
