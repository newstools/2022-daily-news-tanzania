THE Government has reiterated its commitment to continue allocating funds for construction and rehabilitation of water infrastructure in rural and urban areas. Deputy Minister for Water, Ms Maryprisca Mahundi made the assurance yesterday in the House. She stated this when responding to a supplementary question by Ms Husna Sekiboko (Special Seats) who wanted to know the government’s plans to start issuing subsidies to support rehabilitation of water projects in the country. The lawmaker said the government has been issuing subsidies to fund implementation of road projects and why it was failing to do the same in the water sector. In her supplementary question he also sought the government’s plans to hire enough water technicians to supervise safety of water projects. The lawmaker said a number of water projects in rural areas are not working with the villages failing to pay the technicians to repair them due to lack of budget. “In the next fiscal year, we will continue implementing more projects as well as rehabilitation and expansion of more others so as to further improve supply of water in the country,” the deputy minister stated. She assured Tanzanians that the government was committed and is implementing a number of projects in various areas. In another development, Ms Mahundi said in the 2021/22 financial year the government intends to hire technicians so as to effectively serve the projects which include conducting repairs and rehabilitation for smooth supply of the precious liquid to people. “We have a lot of experts including those who graduate from the Water College in Dar es Salaam and thus we have set aside a budget to ensure that we hire enough technicians especially in rural areas where the challenge is big,” she said.
