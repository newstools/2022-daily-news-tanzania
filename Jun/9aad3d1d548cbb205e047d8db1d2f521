DTB Bank members of staff have donated blood to support the National Blood Transfusion Service efforts to address blood shortage and bolster the country’s blood bank. The DTB bank Head of Products Development & Marketing, Sylvester Bahati said in Dar es Salaam over the weekend that the DTB blood donation is part of the financial institution’s corporate social responsibility. "It is our responsibility to donate blood at least to reduce the existing blood shortage to meet the need as those who need blood are our brothers and sisters so we must work together to save their  lives," he said. Mr Bahati said during the blood donation exercise held in the City over the weekend, they planned to collect 80 units of blood. In the National Blood Transfusions Service, the Blood Donor Recruiter, Eastern Zone, Mariam Juma said the annual blood requirement is between 550,000 and 600,000 but the amount collected is only 62 per cent. Ms Juma said if society co-operate together, the blood shortage challenges could be reduced or eliminated. She called on the community to see the importance of participating in blood donation so that more Tanzanians who lose their lives due to anemia can be saved. "Most blood donors in the country are students; I just ask and request adults to come forward because you do not know who will be helped by your blood …..can be your sister, brother  , father, a child or any relative," said Juma, adding that we donate regularly to avoid anemia. She said if Tanzanians were committed the shortage of 38 per cent can be recovered.    She commended DTB bank for opening the doors and asked other institutions, organizations and non-governmental organizations to volunteer blood as an act of compassion.
