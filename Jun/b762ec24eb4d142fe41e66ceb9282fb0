THE Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) in Geita has turned to Village Community Bank (Vicoba) system to support its poverty eradication battle. The TASAF will facilitate the establishment, registration of the Vicoba after members teamed up. Once they opened the fund will pay the members’ monthly grants straight to Vicoba. TASAF Geita Regional Coordinator, Mr Harun Elikana, said the aim is to enable member to access a soft loan through one’s Vicoba and pay using his/her monthly grants from the fund. “The aim is to also enable our members’ access loans and pay through monthly income receiving from TASAF,” Mr Elikana said when presenting the fund report to the Deputy Minister, President’s Office, Public Service and Good Governance Mr Deogratius Ndejembi. The loans will either permit them to engage in economic activities or purchasing household stuff. Also the idea is to enable members to access fund in case of the need instead of waiting for the monthly grants. So far, TASAF has formed some 1,335 Vicoba in Geita region with 18,435 members, where majority are women. According to TASAF the Vicoba will also come up with economic idea which after passing the set down criteria the fund will support purchasing of tools—such as hoes, pangas and the like—and simple machines to facilitate the idea implementation. “We have already set aside some 161.7m/- for that matter to support groups to work on their ideas,” Mr Elikana said. Geita Regional Commissioner, Miss Rosemary Senyamule hailed the fund for its innovative programme that geared on reducing poverty among poor families. The Deputy Minister, Mr Ndejembi, challenged TASAF to look into the possibility of including youths in their new Vicoba scheme.
