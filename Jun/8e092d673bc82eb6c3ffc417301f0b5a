TTCL Corporation’s T-Pesa has partnered with Ngasmake Company Limited to launch Lipa Kwa Uhakika (LKU) service to drive away online business cheats. The platform will enable a customer to partly pay for goods online and the money stored in the system. The seller will see the money in the system and initiate sending of the goods. The balance will be paid once goods are delivered. Thus the LKU will provide a secure financial system service that will protect the buyer and seller. Ngasmake Director General Emmanuel Ngalya said the service target to overcome online business challenges that centred on mistrust between buyer and seller. "Some buyers are hesitant to pay in advance when making an online purchase, yet as merchants, they are unable to ship items without obtaining advance payments,” Mr Ngalya said adding LKU platform want to eliminate the trend. "This challenge prompted us to develop LKU a solution to, in which the customer approves the transaction only after receiving the product and being satisfied with it in terms of quality and all other essentials. "We are assured that the money will be stored for 24 hours before returning or sent to the client," Mr Ngalya said The seller will receive a payment message before they render the service but will be able to use it once his/her customer is satisfied that the service he/she  needed is the one they received. Ngalya said starting the LKU service will definitely cater to local businesses and not overseas. The T-Pesa Director, Ms Luku Mkudde, said the LKU service is unique in the country which guarantees customers the safety of their online transactions and deliverability for both buyer and seller. She said the agreement they entered into with Ngasmake was a one-year renewable contract. Ms Mkudde challenges ‘wananchi’ to use the LKU system to do away fraudulent online transactions.
