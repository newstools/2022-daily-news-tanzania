SOS Children’s Village Tanzania has embarked on a 3-year programme to rehabilitate children in their care to their parents. Speaking in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday, the SOS Children’s Head of Programmes, Anthony Binamuna said that the aim of the programme is to make sure that children in SOS villages are reunited with their families after taking care of them for several years. He said that for the 2022/2023 period, the village plans to reunite 170 children with their parents and families scattered in 37 councils across the country. “In cooperation with local agencies, our organisation runs family strengthening programmes to allow families to effectively care for their children,” he said. He said that so far they take care of 600 children scattered in their villages in Dar es Salaam, Mwanza, Arusha and Zanzibar. On his part, the SOS Children’s Senior Alternative Care Coordinator, Onesmo Itozya said that apart from Tanzania, the rehabilitation programme is also carried out in SOS Children’s Villages in 116 countries. In Tanzania, he said that the village is implementing the programme with support from the government and other partners to ensure smooth transition for the children, some of whom have stayed in the village for more than 13 years. He said that children need to be taken care in a proper family setting, and that it is their aim to make sure that the children are reunited with their families after making sure that they will be given good care. “There are some children who are staying in the SOS villages but in actual sense they are supposed to be with their parents, so we conducted our research to identify families which can take care of their children who are at the village,” he said. He said that when children can no longer live with their families, SOS works with communities and state partners to provide them with loving and supportive alternative care at the villages.
