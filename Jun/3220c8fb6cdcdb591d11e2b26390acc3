A powerful earthquake has killed at least 920 people and left hundreds more injured in Afghanistan, Taliban officials say. Pictures show landslides and ruined mud-built homes in eastern Paktika province, where rescuers are scrambling to treat the injured. In remote areas, helicopters have been ferrying victims to hospitals. Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada said hundreds of houses were destroyed and the death toll was likely to rise. His deputy minister for disaster management Sharafuddin Muslim told a news conference that at least 920 people had been killed and a further 600 injured. The quake struck about 44km (27 miles) from the south-eastern city of Khost shortly after 01:30 local time (21:00 Tuesday GMT), when many people were at home, asleep in their beds.
