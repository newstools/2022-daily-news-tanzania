THE organisers of the annual Kiba-Samatta Charity match slated for June 18th this year have said the game will be used to encourage people to take part in the forthcoming national census to be held in August. The charity encounter will be staged at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam whose proceeds are usually channeled to support communities. In his media address recently, the game’s spokesman Haji Manara reiterated that the move is specifically meant to support the government’s campaign to ensure that many people partake in the census exercise. “Aside from providing entertainment to people, the match will also be used to campaign for the national census which is very important as it helps the government to plan well her development agendas,” Manara said. He added that since the game attracts players from the Premier League, they are also planning to get players who are not featured in the league and will be announced when they are successfully found. He also pointed out that this year’s match will be exceptional basing on the type of players to be included in the respective squads while urging more people to come at the stadium on the day. “Until now, the specific place where the amount to be produced will go has not been declared and I am sure that its destination will be known in the next press conference,” he said. Moreover, Manara said both Kiba and Samatta need to be applauded for creating this initiative of using their fame to give back to the society without having a self-centered behavior. “They could have decided to concentrate solving their family problems but for them, it is a different issue as they are on the front seat to assist others hence a spirit which should be encouraged among our stars,” he remarked. Last season, the game was played at Samora Stadium in Iringa which ended 1-1 and this term, Dar es Salaam has been picked to host it with many people set to witness the encounter on the day.
