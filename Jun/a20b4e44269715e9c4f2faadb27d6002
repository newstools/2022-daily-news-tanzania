Treasury Securities The Bank of Tanzania on behalf of the government administered a 15-year treasury bond which carries a fixed coupon of 11.15%. The government from this particular bond was looking to raise TZS 123Bln ($53.2Mln) from the public but the public only tendered TZS 90.3Bln ($39Mln) to the offer. This means the public only subscribed up to 64% of the offered amount. Historically the 15-years paper hasn’t been investor’s go-to tenor, however it had picked up popularity not long ago, following extreme prices on the longer-tenors investors resorted to 15-year paper as a substitute to the highly priced 20- and 25- years bonds. The yield to Maturity for this paper had slightly declined compared to the previous yield, this is due to the down-ward coupon adjustment by the central bank in Q1, so despite the prices for the current bond being lower, averaging 99.12% the yield stood at 11.27%. Eventually, the government only took one third of the tendered amount, TZS 23Bln ($10.2Mln) returning over TZS 70Bln back to investors.
