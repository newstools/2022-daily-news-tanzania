THE government yesterday stressed that the upgrading of public dispensaries to the status of health centres is jointly done by the Ministry of State in the President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Governments) and the regional secretariats. Deputy Minister of the docket, Dr Festo Dugange, made the assurance in the National Assembly on Tuesday. Earlier, Dr Dugange revealed that the government has allocated 500m/- for the construction of a health centre at Igusule ward. He was responding to a question from Bukene MP Selemani Zedi, who asked why the government did not see the importance of upgrading the Soga village dispensary to the status of a health centre in a bid to enable it serve residents and workers at the ongoing construction of crude oil pipeline from Hoima, Uganda to Tanga Port. The deputy minister noted that Soga village, located in Nzega District, Tabora Region, is among seven villages in the Igusule ward accommodating 23,237 residents. Dr Dugange stated that the ward has only one dispensary at Soga village, which continues to provide medical services to citizens. “President Samia Suluhu Hassan has heard cries of residents at this village, and I will go with you (legislator) to witness the current situation of health service provision at the village. In her supplementary question, Special Seats MP Cecilia Pareso (Chadema), insisted that the work of upgrading dispensaries to health centres status should be given to regional secretaries in order to get rid of bureaucracy.
