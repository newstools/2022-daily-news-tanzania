CHIEF Justice Prof Ibrahim Juma has asked Regional and District Commissioners countrywide to ensure that development programmes in their areas involve improvement of court infrastructure. Prof Juma made the call during the meeting between the Judicial Service Commission and chairpersons of Mtwara Regional and District Ethics Committees in the region. "One of the main issues I always insist on is the need for Regional and District Commissioners to always remember and include the courts in their development programmes implemented by the government in their areas," he said. The CJ mentioned the implementation of various projects such as the National Fibre Optic Cable network, rural electrification, residential addresses and postcode system as well as staff houses as among the services that should be availed to judicial infrastructures, especially in primary courts built in district areas. "As you (Regional and District Commissioners) bring electricity to the villages, you should also remember to electrify primary court buildings built in your areas," he said.
