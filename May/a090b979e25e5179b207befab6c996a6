TRADITIONAL and traditional herbal medicine researchers have asked the government to reduce the cost of traditional medicine testing as they eye to expand their local market and penetrate abroad. Speaking to journalists in Dar es Salaam recently, herbalists’ representative Twalib Msigwa said more researchers would be motivated to test their products to get certificates if passed. According to him,  it is easy to conquer both local and abroad markets only if their remedies have been certified by responsible authorities. He also requested the government to simplify processes of advertising their products on various social media outlets including slashing advertising costs on Youtube. He said that researchers in traditional medicine have been required to advertise themselves through such social networks so that they can be known locally and internationally since their studies have shown positive results in society. "We need to expand the scope of traditional medicine to outside Tanzania so I would ask for operating costs such as advertising through YouTube to be free," he said. The herbalist said he has been complying with government directives by submitting his herbal remedies to the government when he completes each stage of research. "I urge President Samia Suluhu Hassan to take a closer look at natural remedies since she can do something to boost the industry to the next level," he said. He promised to hand over part of his research to President Samia as it was 99 percent complete so that he could look at it with a wide eye.
