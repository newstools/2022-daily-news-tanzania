The 364-day bill yield gained 11 basis points to reach 3.30 per cent from 3.19 per cent, the 182-day bill lost 54 basis points to reach 2.78 per cent from 3.41 per cent, and 91 day bill lost 5 basis points to 2.6 per cent from 2.65 per cent and the 35 day bill lost 5 basis points from 2.35 per cent to 2.30 per cent. Secondary Market In the trading week ending May 7, the yield curve registered a slight uptick on the far end, as the market began adjusting positions ahead of the 25-year Treasury bond auction set for May 11. Overall activities in the secondary market were bearish, in line with our forecast, the value of bonds traded decreased by 33.43 per cent to 35.59bn/- from 53.47bn/- recorded in the previous week. Registering a mere 25 trades relative to 32 trades in the preceding trading week. Reduced trading activities are attributed to the shortness of the trading week due to festivities. This week the Bank of Tanzania will auction a 25- year Treasury bond, we expect the auction to register a high subscription rate as has been the case for long-term bonds. Outlook We expect to see more trading activities for domestic listed equities as we head towards the dividend period. Overall good earnings reported by a number of companies in 2021 will create an incentive for investors to drive momentum for price appreciation in a number of counters, recovery from Covid-19 pandemic and the overall economic growth pulsating a number of companies to higher profitability.
