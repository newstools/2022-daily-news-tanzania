THE Tanzania Agricultural Research Institute (TARI) has urged the government to push for more investment in the sweet potatoes value addition industries in enabling the crop become one of commercial crops in the country. The advice was given recently by TARI Research Officer from Ukiriguru Agricultural College, Dr Khadija Ally, while speaking to sweet potato growers, at Bukoli Ward in Geita District. Dr Khadija said the TARI has already completed the research and come up with better seeds that will raise the production of sweet potatoes, therefore the government should invest on potatoes processing factories for value addition. “Once these potatoes are cultivated capacity to store them for long time is very low, so for the growers in the region to get potato processing factory will help them at least have storage facility and market assurance,” she stressed. She explained that TARI in collaboration with the International Sweet Potato Centre (IPC) is currently pursuing a three-year project to boost sweet potato farming. Dk Khadija recommended that the project dubbed as ‘Sweetgains’ project is expected to promote the cultivation of the crop in the country and widen its market as well. IPC Sweet Potatoes Seed Development Officer, Mr Saadan Edson, said the initial stage of the project started with preparation of the quality seeds aimed at expanding the production and making farmers grow commercially. “Sweet potatoes can serve as an alternative product of wheat demands in our country, we can encourage our seed producers to produce more and potato producers access the best seeds,” he said. Bukoli Agricultural Officer, Ms Anne Kanyege, said the new sweet potato seeds have raised the crop production as the major commercial and food crop for Bukoli residents, but there are still challenges in storage facilities.
