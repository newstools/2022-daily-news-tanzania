THE National U-17 Women team, Serengeti Girls have switched a training camp from Zanzibar to Arusha ahead of their U-17 World Cup match against Cameroon on May 19th this year. The first leg match will be staged in the Cameroonian capital, Yaoundé. Previously Serengeti Girls had pitched a camp in Zanzibar before playing against Botswana and Burundi. The team has qualified to the last stage of Africa World Cup qualifiers after seeing off Burundi by 5-2 aggregate win. Prior to the encounter, Serengeti Girls handed Botswana a 11-0 blitz. Serengeti Girls face Cameroon who eliminated Zambia with 5-0 aggregate victory. The return leg match against Cameroon will be staged in Tanzania on June 4th this year. The team’s Head Coach Bakari Shime said they have picked Karatu in Arusha because its weather is similar to that of Yaoundé, Cameroon. "We have pitched a camp in Karatu because its weather is almost like that of Yaoundé. It is a crucial match for us since it holds a key to World Cup heaven,” he said. He said the team will train in Karatu for 10 days in the exercise that aims to bring the team’s fitness. Tanzanian girls are just one step close to their World Cup arena and Cameroon is last hurdle to the target. Serengeti Girls are among six Africa teams vying for three final World Cup slots. Other teams chasing for the qualifications are Ethiopia who have a serious game against Nigeria and Ghana who will face Morocco in other tense qualifying matches. For ordinary Tanzanians, they should turn up in big numbers when the girls will be hosting Cameroon to give them the required home-backing which will go a long way to add momentum for the team to do better. Reaching India for 2022 FIFA Women's World Cup finals is a mission possible for Serengeti Girls.
