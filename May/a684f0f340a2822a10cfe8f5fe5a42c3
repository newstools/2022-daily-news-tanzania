COFFEE auctions will effective this season be conducted in Kagera Region, with private buyers allowed to present their competitive bids. Kagera Regional Commissioner (RC) Major General Charles Mbuge told the ‘Daily News’ that private companies would allowed to bid at auctions held at the AMCOS level instead of the out-dated system whereby cooperative unions collected and sold the crop at the primary societies. “This is aimed at checking rampant smuggling of the cash crop leading to poor prices to the farmers,” said Maj Gen Mbuge. “The government has taken the bold steps by inviting the private sector to participate in revamping the agricultural sector. During his recent tour in Kagera Prime Minister, Kassim Majaliwa directed that starting this coffee buying season private companies should be allowed to bid at auction held at the AMCOS level. The Premier was irked by nuisance levies imposed by the Kagera Cooperative Union (KCU 1990 Ltd), Karagwe District Cooperative Union (KDCU) and Ngara Farmers’ Cooperative Society (Ngara AMCOS). He cited some of the nuisance levies as burial levy whereby a kilogramme of coffee was deducted 94 cents, uniforms (7/-), leave (50 cents), labourers (23/-), electricity (39/-) and refreshment levy (29/-). Thus he ordered Major General Charles Mbuge to ensure that 47 nuisance taxes are stopped forthwith where a kilogramme of coffee was being deducted about 830/-. The PM said the deduction should not exceed 260/- per kg.
