TANZANIAN business tycoon and major investor, Mohammed (Mo) Dewji, has been conferred Honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters from Georgetown McDonough School of Business. University’s President John DeGioia awarded him an honorary doctorate at the ceremony held over the weekend. “When we embrace the power in community and live in service to others, we find our true path,” Mo Dewji gave an advice the class of 2022 during his commencement keynote address. Mr Dewji emphasized the importance of leveraging the people around you, devoting oneself to others, and building strength in community. He also reminded the 776 undergraduates and 330 graduates in the McDonough School of Business Class of 2022 of a phrase already ingrained into their education as a Hoya: the Jesuit value of cura personalis – sharing a profound sense of responsibility and care for one another. He urged students to never lose sight of these important principles as they progress through their professional careers. “I have no doubt that each of you will follow your unique paths in service to the highest levels,” said Mr Dewji: “But know this: when you reach that level, that’s when it’s easiest to forget how much you need your community.” He urges the Class of 2022 to follow suit: find life’s purpose by connecting their pursuits to the betterment of others.
