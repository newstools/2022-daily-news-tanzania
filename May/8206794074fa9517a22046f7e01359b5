DELAYS in reporting fire incidents have been cited as one of the major challenges facing the Fire and Rescue Force in fulfilling its responsibilities. According to the force, when fire broke out, victims have been trying to fight it on their own instead of reporting the incident to the relevant authorities. Assistant Senior Commissioner of the Fire and Rescue Service who is also the Dodoma Regional Fire and Rescue Commander Julishaeli Mfinanga made the remark in Dodoma recently at the climax of the Fire Service Week celebrations. Dodoma Region marked the climax on May 6, this year at Mnadani Primary School where the force provided awareness on various issues related to rescue services. Commissioner Mfinanga said that according to their research in most incidents especially fire incidents those who call for help are not the victims. "In any incident, the victim is shocked and does not even remember to make an emergency call as a result  he or she may be assisted  by a  passer-by or a neighbors," he said. Reacting to the allegation that the Force has a tendency to arrive at the scene late, he said the Force has never been late noting that  it has been  receiving late  information as a result they arrive at the scene while the damage is enormous. The commissioner also explained that fire trucks have specified capacity for carrying water not only in Tanzania but also in other countries. He  noted that fire trucks  with highest capacity does  not exceed 16,000 liters of water and developed countries use water 'fire hydrant' to be able to complete the rescue event. For her part, Mnadani Primary School Headmistress Joyce Kaishozi said that firefighting education should be provided not only to  pupils  but also the entire community. In addition, she has asked the government to increase firefighting and rescue equipment as the city which was formerly a Municipality is currently growing rapidly.
