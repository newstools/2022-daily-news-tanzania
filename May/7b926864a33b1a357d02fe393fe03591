SIMIYU Regional Commissioner, David Kafulila has suspended all cooperative officers and dissolved 335 Cooperative Societies Agricultural Marketing Cooperative Society (AMCOS) in six district councils in the region due to poor performance of their leaders. RC Kafulila said on Sunday that all farmers will be required to elect new AMCOS leaders in order to increase transparency and accountability in new Cotton Season which starts 20 May this year. He also ordered for guidelines on prices for the crop and be made available. “There has been some irresponsible government officials who have been entrusted to supervise AMCOS, and due to these shortcomings, I have decided to suspend all extension officers and dissolve 335 AMCOS and immediately they should re-elect new leaders, the process will engage all cotton farmers,” he said. He also ordered an investigation by the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) to inspect each AMCOS over selling of farm produce and payments to farmers. He said so far there are 189 AMCOS that have been investigated and it was found that there was no evidence that payment to farmers have been made. According to him, currently Cotton Board estimates show that Simiyu will harvest more than three times of last season harvest, to produce between 250,000 to 300,000 tones. He said in order to increase transparency during the auction which starts in May 20, 2022, each AMCOS will have to disclose price at each centre. “I know the Minister for Agriculture will announce the guidelines for cotton price on May 20 this year, but what I can assure farmers is that the price will be the best price ever since 1990,” concluded Kafulila.
