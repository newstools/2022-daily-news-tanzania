SPEACIAL Olympics Tanzania (SOT) continues to diversify the Play Unified, Learn Unified initiative which aims at promoting integrating culture between people with intellectual challenges and the normal residents in all spheres of life. The programme usually encourages the use of sports as a number one tool of facilitating its implementation and the majority of them countrywide have been reached and benefited. Nyarugusu Refugee Camp in Kigoma has become the recent beneficiary of the project where officials of SOT donated assorted sports gears to enhance unified sports activities at the area. "We are overwhelmed by the reception of people at the camp who have shown strong interest to undertake the initiative and this is what keeps us motivated to continue spreading the programme across the country. "The good thing is that we have partnered with the International Rescue Committee (IRC) who oversees all schools available here and this initiative is set to benefit six schools which accommodate refugees from DR Congo and Burundi," said the Project Coordinator Kelvin Mwise. He added that SOT together with IRC are going to upgrade sports infrastructures available at the camp in order to let athletes play at friendly environment and enjoy the unified sports. He added that to begin with, they have donated 28 balls, 7 volleyball nets and 140 bibs for athletes when engaging in sports activities while insisting that they will be making regular visits at the camp to see their progress. Play Unified, Learn Unified initiative is financed by Stavros Niarchos Foundation (SNF) and Tanzania is among the few countries on the continent hosting it.
