THE immaculate Tanzania People’s Defence Forces (TPDF) Lugalo Golf course turns a battlefield today when over 70  tee off in the 3rd edition of the Galinoma Memorial golf tournament. The tournament gives the golf family an opportunity to pay homage to the former Lugalo Golf Club chairman, the  late Brigadier General (rtd) Ernest Galinoma. The day-long 18 holes tournament is scheduled to tee off at the par-72 Lugalo course today starting with various course and clinics. It has been organised by Lugalo club in collaboration with the Galinoma family. It will be the third edition of the event to mark six years since the chairman died. One of the organisers, Alex Galinoma told the ‘Daily News’ in Dar es Salaam over the weekend that preparation for the tournament has been completed  and everything is in place. Alex Galinoma, who started to follow his father footsteps in golf, said the tournament is open for men and ladies and junior golfers. “We are delighted to be able to organise the event again this year; we came from a difficult time when we could not do it in recent years due to the corona virus threat,” he said. “Thanks God everything is well now, we are happy to invite golfers to come forward in big numbers to take part in  this special day,” he added. Alex also thanked Lugalo Club for their heartfelt support in organising the event and said it is very important for them as a family since their father was always an active golfer. He said the registration for those wishing to participate has been closed and over 70  golfers  had already confirmed participation. Galinoma, the senior golfer, died at Muhimbili Referral Hospital in the city on April 17 in 2016 and was laid to rest at Kalenga Village in Iringa. The sudden demise of the chairman shocked many golfers all over the country. He was also a member of the Dar es Salaam Gymkhana Club (DGC) before joining Lugalo Club.
