DAR ES SALAAM Stock Exchange (DSE) closed April with a strong performance as equity turnover more than tripled compared to March. The April’s equity turnover jumped three times to 16.5bn/- from 5.15bn/- that was generated in March. Orbit Weekly Market Synopsis showed that during the month under review the number of shares traded tripled to over 21 million from 7.7 million traded in March. “Foreign investors maintained their lead on the market, where they consisted of the majority buy-side and sell-side activity,” Orbit weekly report said.
