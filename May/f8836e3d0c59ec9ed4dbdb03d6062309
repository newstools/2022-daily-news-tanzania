A woman who took up running after she lost her left leg to cancer has passed the Guinness World Record for most consecutive marathons. Jacky Hunt-Broersma, 46, has run 26.2-miles every day since mid-January, normally taking around five hours. On Saturday, she completed her 104th consecutive marathon in as many days - an achievement she expects to be certified by Guinness World Records. A spokesperson said certifying the record would take around three months. Waking up on Sunday - a day off at long last - was a bizarre experience for Jacky. "Part of me was really happy to be done," she tells the BBC from her home in Arizona. "And the other part kept thinking I need to go running." Her body is also recovering from the record-chasing effort, despite having stopped. "I feel tighter than I have the whole 104 marathons," she admits. But Jacky - who was born and raised in South Africa, and has also lived in England and the Netherlands - is grateful. Because running has given her the confidence she was afraid she would never regain.
