TANZANIA will have to wait until July this year to chase the Africa Region 4 golf title. Formerly known as East Africa Golf Challenge trophy, it was earlier scheduled to tee off in Kampala, Uganda in June before it was pushed to the first week of July at the same venue. Tanzania Golf Union (TGU) competition Secretary Enock Magile told the 'Daily News' in Dar es Salaam on Thursday that the tournament has been moved to July but he could not explain the reasons behind the change. "The Confederation of African Golf has also made changes for the All Africa Challenge Trophy, which will now be staged in the second week of October 2022 in Egypt," he added. Both tournaments couldn't be staged in the last two years due to the Coronavirus pandemic, before the body decided last year to bring both events this year. It is jointly organised by East Africa Golf Federation and hosts Uganda going as the Region 4 Team competition that brings together top players from member countries. Magile named member countries expected to participate as Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Burundi, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Sudan, Eritrea, Somalia, Djibouti, Comoros, Mauritius, Seychelles and Madagascar. The teams will compete in a singles match-play round battle, foursomes, four-balls round and another single match-play round on the final day. Uganda are the defending champions after they collected aggregate 18.5 points and edged Kenya by a point to win the 16th edition in 2019. Tanzania finished fourth with Rwanda, Ethiopia and Burundi finishing third, fifth and sixth respectively. Magile stressed that preparation has already started as they gear up to bring back the golf glory. Top players Victor Joseph, Isihaka Daudi, Ali Mcharo and George Sembi have all it takes to make the country proud after missing it for a long time. Tanzania last won the regional golf title in 2002 in Arusha.
