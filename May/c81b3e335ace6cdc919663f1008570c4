Actress Patricia Brake, known for her roles in BBC sitcom Porridge and ITV drama Manhunt, has died aged 79 after being diagnosed with cancer, her family has said. Her agent Scott Marshall Partners said Brake would be "sadly missed" by her friends, family, colleagues and fans. Brake's 60-year career saw her play roles in television soaps Coronation Street, Emmerdale and EastEnders. But she was best known to viewers in the 1970s for her role in Porridge. Brake played Ingrid, the daughter of Ronnie Barker's Norman Stanley Fletcher and she reprised the same role in Going Straight, alongside Richard Beckinsale and Nicholas Lyndhurst. Over the years, she had roles in Midsomer Murders, Doctors, Casualty, Holby City, 2point4 Children and Eldorado. She worked with the Two Ronnies and Morecambe and Wise and in the late 1970s was seen every Saturday night as Eth in The Glums.
