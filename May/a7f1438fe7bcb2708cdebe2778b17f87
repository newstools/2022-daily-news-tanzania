Prime Minister, Kassim Majaliwa has ordered authorities to confiscate passports of the South Korean-based firm GAS Entec officials building the MV Hapa Kazi Tu ship  in Mwanza. He gave the directions on Saturday shortly after inspecting the construction of the ship in Mwanza while instructing the regional immigration officer to ensure that none of the constructors leave the region until the completion of the work. “I have heard that there are seven of them but here I see only three. Look for the other four,” The Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa said. The minister who furiously showed not to be satisfied with the rate of the ongoing construction said he had discovered that the GAS Entec Company had sold its shares without the government being notified “Those to whom the shares were sold to, came and were surprised to see the construction of the ship since the construction was out of their agreement,” he added. Additionally, Mr Majaliwa stated that the government had paid 80 per cent of the ship's construction but only 65 per cent of the work had been and that according to information given to him there were 118 employees but there are only 22 left.
