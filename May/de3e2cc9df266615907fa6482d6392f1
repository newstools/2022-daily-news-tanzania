The African Champions League final will be played in Morocco on 30 May after Senegal withdrew its bid to host the game. The Confederation of African Football's (Caf) announcement came a day after Champions League semi-finalists Al Ahly asked for the match to played at a neutral venue. The Egyptian reigning champions hold a 4-0 advantage over Algeria's Entente Setif after the first leg of the semi-final. Moroccan club Wydad Casablanca lead Petro Atletico of Angola 3-1 after the opening leg of their final-four tie. The exact venue for the match has not been announced yet. Caf also added that it is also discussing reverting to the old two-legged home and away format for the final. The decision to make the final a single match was taken by the previous Caf leadership in July 2019.
