The government has embarked on a strategy of looking for an alternative way of easing the cost of living of citizens following the recent rise of fuel price in the global market. The revelation was made by Prime Minister, Kassim Majaliwa, while meeting government officials in Dar es Salaam tasked to evaluate the rise of fuel price in the country on Thursday. “I urge citizens to be calm and trust the government. We are continuing to do everything we can to ensure that we reduce the cost of living,” he pointed out. Elaborating, he noted that the Ministry of Energy was already looking for alternative ways including importing fuel as well as reducing related deductions aimed at reducing fuel price.
