THE State Mining Company (STAMICO) has signed a 250bn/- deal with a Switzerland-based company ABSA Commodities to embark on massive coal extraction. The agreement to that effect was signed in Dodoma on Wednesday. It will last for five years and will see the government earning 50bn/- per annum in levies and royalties. Deputy Minister for Minerals, Dr Steven Kiruswa said under the agreement, ABSA will purchase 60,000 tonnes of coal monthly from Kiwira Coal Mine located in Songwe Region. “This means that the company will purchase 720,000 tonnes of coal every year and by the end of the contract, the company will have purchased 3.6 million tonnes, which will see the government pocket 250bn/-,” said the deputy minister. The deal, according to Dr Kiruswa, will create 600 direct jobs with 300 huge vehicles expected to transport the coal to Mtwara Port from Songwe. The task of transporting the minerals has been handed to Drumlin Contractors limited from Tanzania. The deputy minister said the signing of the contract was part of the strategies put in place by the government, to ensure that STAMICO was operating efficiently. Dr Kiruswa said from July, 2021 to March, this year, STAMICO extracted 17,324 tonnes of coal in which 12,792 tonnes was sold. ABSA Commodities president Georges Schmickrath said extension of the contract after five years will depend on the success of the current agreement, expressing hope that the contract will be a success. STAMICO Acting Director General Dr Venance Mwasse said the agreement was part of the company's plan to start massive coal extraction. He said all was set for the project to kick-start, including preparing infrastructure such as roads and storage facilities.
