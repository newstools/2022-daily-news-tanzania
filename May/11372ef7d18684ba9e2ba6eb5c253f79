NKASI District Magistrate's Court in Rukwa region has sentenced Peter Malema (21) to life imprisonment after being found guilty of raping a four years old girl. The man is a resident of Nkundi village at Kipande ward in Nkasi District. Reports available at the court show that the same court sentenced him to 30 years in jail after he was found guilty of raping a minor girl. However, he challenged both the sentence and conviction at the Court of Appeal, where he was freed after he won his appeal. Delivering the verdict mid last week, trial magistrate Mr Benedict Nkomola said prosecution side had proved the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubts that he had indeed committed the offence. “The act the accused committed is barbaric and inhuman …I pass this severe sentence of life imprisonment as a lesson not only to him, but also deter others with similar behavior,” judged the trial magistrate. He further explained that the accused had committed the crime against Section 130 (1) and (2) (e) and Section 131 (3) of Penal Code (R.E 16, 2019) Prosecution side summoned eight witnesses to substantiate its case beyond reasonable doubts.The prosecution side led by Denis Chagike assisted by Sedrick Mashauri charged before the court that Malema committed the crime on March 23, 2021 at Nkundi village, where he raped the four years minor girl and subsequently caused severe bodily harm on her. He appealed to the court to impose harsh sentence to the accused because he is not the first offender Mr Chagike charged that the accused had previous criminal record that the same court had sentenced him to serve 30 years in jail but he won his appeal to Court of Appeal and was freed.
