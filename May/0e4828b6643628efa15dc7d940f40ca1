At least 27 people have been killed and others are missing after a fire swept through a four-storey office building in Delhi. More than 70 people were inside when the fire started and witnesses said some jumped out of windows to escape. Women made up the majority of the office's workers. The BBC found distraught family members waiting outside a local hospital for news. A short circuit is thought to have started the fire. The owners of a CCTV manufacturing company which was housed in the building have been arrested in connection with the incident, according to authorities. One of the women missing is 19-year-old Pooja, who is her family's main bread winner. At the Sanjay Ghandi Memorial Hospital in western Delhi, her 14-year-old sister Moni told the BBC her and her mother had run to the hospital as soon as they had heard about the fire. "She had gone to office at nine in the morning. She worked as data entry operator. She could not take her phone, so, she could not give us a call." SOURCE: BBC
