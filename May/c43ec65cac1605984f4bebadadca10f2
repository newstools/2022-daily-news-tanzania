KAGERA Regional Administrative Secretary (RAS), Prof Faustin Kamuzora has urged residents and all Tanzanians to collectively fight against norms and traditions that oppress women. He also emphasized that gender equality is important in realising sustainable development of any nation noting that gender violence was still high, resulting in increased maternal deaths. “Unfortunately in our society, there are still systems that are embedded with norms and traditions that oppress women. The norms categorise a woman’s job as attending to their husbands, children and sick people. Basically her place is at home. In the eyes of male chauvinism, women are not supposed to be leaders and participate in decision making process at any level. More effort is needed to attain Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which required nations to record 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 women by 2030,” he said. Prof Kamuzora also appealed to males to take a holistic approach in eliminating Gender Based Violence (GBV) and Violence Against Children (VAC) which are among cross-cutting issues which should be addressed collectively. A national survey conducted in 2010 revealed that 45 per cent of women aged 15-49 years had reported gender-based violence (GBV), while another seven per cent had reported sexual violence. Data for Kagera Region, on the other hand, revealed that 49.4 per cent of women and girls aged 15 years had reported GBV while 29.2 per cent had been sexually exploited. The World Health Organisation (WHO) revealed in a report conducted in 2005 in ten countries that prevalence of physical violence by an intimate partner was between 13-61 per cent.
