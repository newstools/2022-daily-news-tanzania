New Zealand has reopened its borders to more international visitors after a pandemic lockout of more than two years. Travellers touched down at Auckland Airport on Monday, many to emotional reunions with family and friends. People from more than 60 countries are now able to enter the country if they're vaccinated and Covid-negative. Citizens have been able to travel in and out since March, while Australians have been let in since April. One US man said he had travelled from Cincinnati to be with his partner. He had been waiting since February 2020 - when he applied for the visa. "I'm finally here today. I've never been within 6,000 miles of this country and my first time here. I'm home. It's the best feeling I've ever had," David Benson told the BBC.
