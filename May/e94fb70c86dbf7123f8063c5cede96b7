TANZANIA International Container Terminal Services (TICTS) has invested 12.5bn/- and purchased three additional rubber-tyred gantry cranes (RTGCs) and one reach-stacker. Hutchison Ports Managing Director—Middle East and Africa Andy Tsoi said as a member of the Hutchison Ports, TICTS benefits from the access to a wide range of support from the group. “We have a long history of partnership in Tanzania and are very keen to continue to support growth in Tanzania and the region,” Mr Tsoi said through a release. Also commenting on the equipment arrival, TICTS Acting Chief Executive Officer Matt Clifft, said the additional equipment will help the container handling terminal meet the demand of the upcoming peak season. “Our aim is to minimise waiting time and maximise productivity,” Mr Clifft said. Located at Berths 8 through 11, TICTS operates 725 meters at the port with six quay cranes each with a handling capacity of 45 metric tonnes. With the equipment arrival, the terminal currently has a fleet of 23 RTGCs which work the stacking area of 18.75 hectares. TICTS recently had its most productive month on record handling over 61,000 TEU in March. More recently the terminal broke its daily record handling 2,841 Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit (TEU) in May.
