BENEFICIARIES of the free medical screening exercise conducted by Special Olympics Tanzania (SOT) at Nyarugusu Refugees Camp in Kigoma have hailed the exercise calling it very humane. The campaign benefited over 150 intellectual disabled athletes drawn from different schools and communities within the camp. In his remarks, SOT National Director Charles Rays thanked the intellectual challenged athletes who actively took part in the exercise saying it was very crucial and served the purpose. "As SOT, we always conduct free medical screening campaigns to these athletes because most of them rarely have opportunities to undergo such procedures whose services are charged at health centers, but for us, we do it free of charge. "I would also like to appreciate a team of health professionals who conducted the screenings for their immense contributions because it was not an easy task to serve such a big number of athletes in two days," noted Rays. He also pointed out that before the screening, families and 20 health care practitioners were taken through an informative session aimed at giving them skills on how they can easily work with intellectual disabled people. In her appreciation remarks, Zick Mlonge, a guardian of an intellectual disabled athlete who benefited from the free medical screening, called on SOT to make frequent visits at the camp for similar exercise. "I am thankful to God because my son is one of the beneficiaries of the exercise and he is now progressing well. Here, we encounter many problems when it comes to determining health of these athletes. "This child is an orphan. I am the one who take care of him and he frequently falls ill that is why we need massive support from well-wishers because I also do not have a husband or a relative," said Mlonge, a refugee from DR Congo
