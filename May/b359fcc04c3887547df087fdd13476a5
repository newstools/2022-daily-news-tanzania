President Biden has named Karine Jean-Pierre as his new top spokesperson - the first time a black, or openly gay, person has held the role. Ms Jean-Pierre, 44, has served as the administration's principal deputy press secretary since Mr Biden was elected. She will replace outgoing press secretary Jen Psaki, 43, in the top role at the end of next week. Press secretaries conduct daily news briefings with White House reporters, meaning the role can be high-profile. Ms Psaki is taking up a job at the left-leaning MSNBC cable news outlet. On Twitter, she called her successor a "remarkable woman" with "a moral core". "I can't wait to see her shine as she brings her own style, brilliance and grace to the podium," she said.
