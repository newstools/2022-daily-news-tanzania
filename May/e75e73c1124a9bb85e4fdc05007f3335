PRODUCTION of quality seedlings by Zanzibar Agricultural Research Institute (ZARI) failed due to financial constraints, the House of Representatives heard here on Friday. The institute had planned in the 2021/2022 fiscal year to produce quality banana, cassava and sweet potato seedlings under the tissue culture technology. Agriculture, Irrigation, Natural Resources and Livestock Minister, Mr Shamata Shaame Khamis told the house that the institute embarked on the research during the period through identification of the best practices. During the period, 1028 parent seedlings at the fourth leaf stage for sweet potatoes (462), cassava (296), bananas (194) and 76 eucalyptus were germinated, the minister told the house. He further said the seedlings had to undergo the multiplication stage before being moved to the green house prior to the acclimatisation stage that would have involved distribution of the seedlings to farmers but due to lack of funds to construct the green houses, the seedlings died. Minister Shaame said the seedlings overstayed in the growth chambers as a result contracted fungus and died. Only 44 cassava seedlings, two and 30 banana and potato seedlings, respectively, have remained, the minister said. Responding to Kiwani Representative Mussa Foum Mussa who sought to know the fate of the project, the minister said the institute is exploring various funding sources to construct the green houses for the project though some of the requests to public and private financiers have not been responded to.
