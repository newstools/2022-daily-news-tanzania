Goodfellas actor Ray Liotta has died in his sleep in the Dominican Republic at the age of 67. The US star had been on location filming the movie Dangerous Waters, his publicist Jennifer Allen said. He was best known for playing mobster Henry Hill in Martin Scorsese's 1990 gangster film Goodfellas and also appeared in Field of Dreams. Liotta got his big break playing ex-convict Ray Sinclair in 1986 black comedy Something Wild. He got a Golden Globe nomination for that role and went on to star in the 1988 film Dominick and Eugene, about the strained relationship between twins with very different characters.
