MULEBA District Commissioner (DC) Mr Toba Nguvila has warned residents to avoid taking the law in their own hands; instead, they should report the suspects to relevant authorities for necessary action. He sounded the warning following a recent incident where a man was allegedly crucified on the cross for reasons yet to be established. “The rule of law does not allow people taking the law in their own hands. Instead they should report the suspects to relevant authorities for necessary action,” he said. “It is premature to identify the three suspects who are in police custody as full investigations were still in progress. They will be arraigned in court when investigations are completed,” he said. He explained that the incident happened on April 22 this year at Kagoma village while three suspects were helping police investigations. However, he said the victim identified as Albert Msala (23), who sustained severe injuries due to being nailed on the cross was admitted to Rubya Designated Hospital (DDH) and was in stable condition.
