MORE than 450 farmers have benefited from agro- ecology farming project aimed at identifying champion farmers (Lead farmers), who would play a major role in training other farmers. In the course, the project has so far trained a number of farmers in all eight Dodoma districts and Singida region, especially in Ikungi and Itigi districts. Speaking to journal- ists in Kongwa District over the weekend, Tanzania Agricultural Research Institute (TARI) Makutupora Centre Coordinator for Research and Innova- tion, Mr Elirehema Swai, said TARI’s intention was to introduce agro ecology activities to farmers to get more produce and prevent soil erosion. He said after TARI realised that the farm officials could not reach the farmers at the grassroots countrywide, TARI Makutupora Centre as well came up with a new approach to empower the peasants themselves so they also become ambassadors and teach agro ecological education to others. Mr Swai said the farmers have been well trained on how best to plant maize and pigeon peas, and sorghum with pigeon peas as well as the environmentally friendly Gliricidia Sepium trees. “Other technologies are rainwater harvesting through the use of tied ridging, control of soil erosion using special Fanya Juu, Fanya Chini terraces, shelter belts as well as Farmers Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR),” said Mr Swai Elaborating on the other product dubbed ‘Fanya Juu, Fanya Chini’ he said adding, “This prevents rainwater from outside to flow into the farm, and, hence prevents soil erosion by protecting the fertile soil in the farm from flowing away.” According to him the project also provided the farmers with drought tolerant varieties, nota- bly-T-105 maize from Kibaha Centre and Macia sorghum from Hombolo for the farmers to increase their yields. Mr Swai said they have decided to partner with key local and international like-minded agro stakeholders to capacitate the farmers in Kongwa District of Dodoma Region on better agronomic practices, being with an eye to help them cheat challenges of climate change. The stakeholders include LEAD Foundation, the International Crops Research Institute of the Semi- Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) with useful financial support from the Biovision Foundation for Ecological Development of Switzerland.
