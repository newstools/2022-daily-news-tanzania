THE Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) trade ties with the other EAC partner states will increase significantly after the country has joined the Community, according to the East African Business Council (EABC). Director of the EABC Board, Mr Emmanuel Nkusi, said this at the business meeting in Goma, organised by EABC and the Federation of Enterprises of Congo (FEC). Mr Nkusi said in 2020, EAC countries imported goods worth 49.2 million US Dollars from the DRC while exported 584 million US Dollars to DRC. He congratulated the people and the Government of the DRC led by President Félix Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo for signing of the Treaty of the Accession of the DRC into the EAC. Top EAC exports to DRC include lime and cement, iron and steel, tobacco, beverages, spirits and vinegar, animal or vegetable fats and oils, wheat gluten, sugars and confectionery, plastics, and soap among other products. On his part, the President of FEC-Goma, Mr Bercky Chirimwami said: “We are eager to build the capacity of DRC business people to ably trade in the EAC Common Market.” He urged businesspeople in DRC to look for opportunities in cross-border trade and investments. EABC Chief Executive Officer, Mr John Bosco Kalisa said DRC joining the EAC has paved the way for waiving visa fees and improvement of regional transport infrastructure. This is set to reduce the cost of doing business. Currently, Tanzanians and Ugandans entering DRC have to pay a visa valid for 30 days charged at 50 US Dollars and vice versa. Women cross-border traders in DRC have appealed for trainings on how to export to the EAC to be rolled out. The Goma OneStop Border Post links Rwanda and DRC. In 2019, Rwanda’s exports of goods to DRC stood at 372.5 million US Dollars while Rwanda’s imports from DRC stood at 16.7 million US Dollars.
