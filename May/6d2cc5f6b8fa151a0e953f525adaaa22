HOPE for Girls and Women Tanzania (HGWT), a local NGO has embarked on a long education campaign that seeks to save primary school girls from undergoing Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) ahead of this year’s African Child Day commemoration. The NGO’s latest anti-Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) campaigns which kicked off last week target 40 primary schools in Tanzanian’s wildlife rich district of Serengeti in Mara region. Making the revelation here, an official from HGWT, Mr Emmanuel Goodluck said the campaigns which involved the Police Force Gender and Children Desk, Social Welfare and Community Development officials in the district are meeting school girls to enlighten them on the effects of FGM and child marriages. “We started on May 10th this year and the exercise will run for 10 consecutive days... we will pass to provide education on the effects of Gender Based Violence (GBV) espe- cially FGM and child marriages in 40 primary schools in Serengeti District so that the girls can say no to FGM and child marriages,” he told reporters in Mugumu over the weekend. He mentioned some of the schools reached by the campaigns last week as Kwitete, Nyangwe, Masangura, Kichongo A and Kichongo B. According to Mr Goodluck, the campaign is part of the activities being conducted by the NGO ahead of this year’s African Child Day an- nually marked on 16th June every year. Elaborating, he noted that formation of anti- GBV clubs in the targeted schools would also be given priory during the same period. He added, “It is further us- ing the opportunity to prepare girls who may be at risk of being subjected to forced FGM in the next season so that they escape to its safe house rescue centre(s) as well as reporting such GBV acts to the law enforcement organs for legal actions.”
