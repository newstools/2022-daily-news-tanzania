THE government and the International Trade Center (ITC) have urged country’s honey producers to produce quality products that meet standards so that they can access local, regional and international markets and make the industry contribute more to the country’s economic growth. Acting Director of Business Development from the Tanzania Trade Development Authority (Tantrade), Ms Masha Hussein, made the statement during a workshop of stakeholders from six regions of Tanzania Mainland and Zanzibar to discuss about beekeeping issues. She said they have already opened a honey market in Saudi Arabia and more than 10 companies have started trading honey products. National Coordinator of the Tanzania Beekeeping Value Chain Support Programme at the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism, Department of Forestry and Beekeeping, Ms Magdalena Muya, said the fiveyear project (2021-2024), which cost about 10 million Euros was funded by the European Union (EU). The centre also guarantees beekeepers access to markets, trade and equipment to produce quality honey. She said after the launch of the project, various institutions involved in the production and value addition of bee products started identifying beekeepers and helped them. “In order to increase the value of bee products, we must ensure that their equipment are improved,” she stated. The project aims to improve Beekeeping Value Chain through enhanced quality production, value addition of bee product and strengthen trade. According to her, they will continue to provide regular training to beekeepers, small and medium enterprises and improve their equipment as well as provide them with education on how to find markets abroad. On his side, a beekeeper, Mr Ayubu Kamwaga said the center would help them alleviate lack of market and create competition for honey.
