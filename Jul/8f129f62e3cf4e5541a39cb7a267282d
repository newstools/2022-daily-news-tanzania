THE government has warned drivers across the country against staging unlawful strike to press for increment of their remunerations. Minister of State in Prime Minister’s Office (Labour, Employment, Youth and People with Disabilities), Prof Joyce Ndalichako stressed in a statement that legal action will be taken against those who are mobilising for the illegal industrial action. “I urge all drivers to continue with their work and appreciate the positive gesture by the government to address complaints raised by their association and owners of motor vehicles,” she said. Prof Ndalichako stated further that their complaints related to the rate of travel allowance have been heard and addressed, while doors are still open for more discussions. The minister explained that after discussions between the government on one hand and representatives of drivers and owners of vehicles on the other, the parties agreed on minimum travel allowances. “Owners of the vehicles should adhere to the agreed minimum rates and for those who were paying above the minimum rate should not lower the amount as doing so is against the law,” she explained.
