GEITA Gold Mining Company Limited (GGML) in collaboration with the Geita District Police Force Road Safety Office has launched a special road safety campaign to fight against road accidents in the district. The GGML campaign involves the provision of road safety education to about 25 primary schools aiming at rescuing more than 40,000 students in the Geita district. GGML Senior Public Relationship Manager, Mr Manace Ndoroma said the company’s investment goes along with the fight against any sort of accidents. "We have trained more than 160 Bajaji drivers found in 15 bajaj centres within Geita town, many of whom are serious traffic offenders in the region. "Our campaign to promote road safety for the community around us is important as we would like the community to avoid deaths or disabilities due to negligence in preventable accidents," said Mr Manace. Acting Chief of Geita District Road Safety Force, Mr Emanuel Nyagawa said the campaign under GGML is going to help students and bajaj drivers to mark attention to road traffic rules. “So far we have already successfully provided this training to more than 9,000 students and more than 15 bajaj centres in Geita town. We focus to change their risky behaviours,” he said. The Chairman of the Geita Bajaji Drivers' Union, Mr Benjamin Kasili, said education for bajaj drivers would help reduce accidents by making drivers adhere to traffic laws as per the government's expectations.
