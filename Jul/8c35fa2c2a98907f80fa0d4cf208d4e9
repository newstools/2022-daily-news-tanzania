Leaders from the seven East African Community (EAC) Partner States will this week appoint judges to the East African Court of Justice (EACJ). The exercise is part of the 22nd EAC Heads of State Ordinary Summit and retreat which begin here on Thursday. EACJ is a treaty-based judicial body of the EAC tasked to ensure adherence to law in the interpretation and application of and compliance with the East African Community Treaty of 1999. The Court is made up of two divisions namely the First Instance Division and an Appellate Division. Its Judges, a maximum of ten in the First Instance Division and of five in the Appellate Division, are appointed by the East African Community Summit, the highest organ of the community, from among persons recommended by the Partner States who are of proven integrity, impartiality and independence and fulfill the conditions required in their own countries for high judicial office, or are jurists of recognised competence. The Arusha based Court has jurisdiction over the interpretation and application of the Treaty and may have other original, appellate, human rights or other jurisdiction upon conclusion of a protocol to realise such extended jurisdiction. Reference to the court may be by Legal and Natural Persons, Partner States and the Secretary General of the community. In the same vein, the Heads of State will on Friday launch the 42.4 kilometer Arusha Bypass Road. The bypass is part of the multinational Arusha – Holili /Taveta – Voi Road Project. It was co-funded by the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Africa Trade Fund and the governments of Tanzania and Kenya to the tune of $ 173.86 million. Since its completion, the stretch has relieved the busy Moshi - Arusha road and has facilitated the traffic from Mombasa port wishing to join the Central Corridor at Singida.
