DODOMA Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DUWASA) plans to speed up process of tapping water from the Mtera dam to serve Dodoma, being the urgent solution to address water shortage in the capital city. The project is estimated to cost 326bn/-, a soft loan from the World Bank (WB) and the project is expected to be completed after two years. Briefing the media in Dodoma yesterday, DUWASA Managing Director, Engineer Aron Joseph said that the project will curb water woes in the city. Eng Joseph revealed that so far DUWASA supplies water to 82 per cent of the population in the capital city. He added that the actual demand in the city is 133 million litres per day. However, the authority has a capacity of producing only 67.1 million litres per day that is only 50 per cent of the demand. "Mtera project is very key among other plans that we have on the table. WB has already shown interest to support" he said. The DUWASA boss expressed that the authority in collaboration with the Ministry of Water has a long-term plan to ensure that water supply in the capital is sufficient, including the plan for its water network from Lake Victoria. However, he detailed that through the Covid-19 relief fund (1.1b/-), the authority has drilled six water wells that benefited more than 40 million residents in several places. Eng Joseph said that DUWASA is still working out on long-term projects, including construction of Farkwa dam that is expected to supply more than 128 million litres of the precious liquid. "We are in the final stages of negotiation with a consultant for construction design that will be followed with several phases of construction," he added. Regarding supply of water in the new government town of Mtumba (Magufuli City), Eng Joseph hinted that government has allocated 94b/- to construct the network.
