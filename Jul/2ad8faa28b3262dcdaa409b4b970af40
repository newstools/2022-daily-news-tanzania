MARINE Services Company Limited (MSCL) has increased passenger fares for Lake Victoria ferries, MV Victoria and MV Butiama with effect from today due to a steep rise in operating cost. The Company’s Public Relation Officer, Mr Abdulrahman Salim, said the new rates for MV Victoria, whose route is Mwanza to Bukoba would be 21,000/- for economy class up from 16,000/-. Fares for a business class would be 40,000/- from 30,000/- and the first class would cost 55,000/- from 45,000, he said. New shipping rates for MV Butiama, whose route is Mwanza to Nansio (Ukerewe District) are 10,000/- from 8,000/- and 12,000/- from 10,000/-, he said. MV Butiama has only two classes, according to Mr Salim, insisting that the new fares of both vessels are for only passengers and not cargoes. The new rates are for passengers of 12 years old and above. Children from five to 11 years old will be paying half of an adult shipping rate in a certain class,” he said. Last time the fares were reviewed for economy class of MV Victoria was in 2011, he said. He said that the review considered the economic status of the citizens, especially for third class, whose new rate is still affordable compared to road transport charges. The passengers for both marine vessels aired different views on news shipping rates, with some saying that the changes were of short notice while others accepted them. “The new rates supposed to be announced at-least two weeks before they are charged to let people get prepared,” said Ms Emmi Mtemi, soon after she disembarked from Nansio. The Passengers for MV Victoria, including Mr Richard Pastory, commented that new rates should be accepted given the fact the fuel prices are not friendly to all transporters. “Marine authorities have given us enough time for preparation compared to upcountry and commuter buses, whose new transport fares got in use about three month back,” he said.
