Azam face KCCA in the finals of Cambiasso Under-20 International Tournament at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam today. The competition which brought together 12 teams, climaxes today with the epic clash as Tanzanians are keen to see their team  claim the silverware. They, however have to overcome KCCA's hurdle to get a chance of being decorated the tournament's champions. To reach this far, Azam bundled out Aigle Noir of Burundi 2-1 after roaring from behind to produce a convincing win. On the other hand, KCCA sent packing Montpellier HSC of France courtesy of a slim 1-0 win with a winner  netted in the 87th minute.  It was the first defeat that the French side suffered during the competition as their unbeaten run came to an end but they were among the best performers who really enjoyed partaking the contest.  On his part, Azam's Cyprian Kachwele who was voted man of the match during their semifinal match against Aigle Noir said their focus is just on winning the championship saying that is their target. "Now that we have progressed to the finals, our priority is to just be crowned the new champions of the tournament and by working together, we can easily achieve that," he said.
