Young Africans Sports Club has expressed its disappointment following Tanzania's Football Federation (TFF)'s move to ban its chief spokesperson Haji Manara for being disrespectful to the football governing body. The outspoken Manara has been banned from soccer for two years and fined 20m/-. The newly crowned Mainland Premier League winners claimed in a statement issued on Thursday evening, hours after TFF's announcement, that the decision will retard Manara's efforts in Tanzania's soccer. Early on Thursday, The Tanzania Football Federation (TFF)’ Ethics and Disciplinary Committee announced its decision to imposed a two-year ban on Young Africans Chief Spokesperson. The Committee' ruling against Mr Manara has attracted different views from soccer pundits, fans and even politicians, dividing them with some claiming that the Federation was right to discipline Manara while a section of other blames TFF for "harsh punishment." The outspoken Manara has also been fined 20m/-. A statement issued by TFF on Thursday stated that Manara has been disciplined by the committee after a misunderstanding with Federation boss during a final match of the Federation Cup played on July 2, 2022. Manara’s side, Young Africans emerged winners after beating Coastal Union in penalty kicks. Few days after the quarrels, Manara accompanied by his club’s newly elected President Hersi Said in a group photo with Karia, purporting that the Spokesperson had gone to apologize over what happened at Sheikh Amri Abeid Stadium’s VVIP area. The next day, Manara held a press conference where he apologized publicly for what transpired in Arusha between the two.
