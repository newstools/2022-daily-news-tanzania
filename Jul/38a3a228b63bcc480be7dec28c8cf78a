YOUNG Africans have sided with their suspended Spokesperson Haji Manara who is seeking further justice saying they are not satisfied with the 2-year ban and 20m/- fine slapped to him by the Disciplinary Committee of Tanzania Football Federation (TFF). The committee recently slapped Manara with a two-year suspension from engaging in any football related matters plus being fined 20m/- for allegedly showing disrespect to TFF's president Wallace Karia. "As a club, we believe that Manara has received unfair judgement for being banned for two years and fined 20m/- concurrently. As such, we rally with him in his endeavour to seek further justice from higher levels," reads part of the statement issued by the club's Media and Information Department. Meanwhile, Yanga have intensified preparations ahead of the coming 2022/23 season which officially starts on August 13th this year by facing their traditional rivals Simba in a Community Shield encounter. The Jangwani Street giants are on the ground drilling for both domestic and international assignments. They will, however, face an uphill task in their quest to defend the three titles they won last season from other teams like Simba and Azam. Simba and Azam have also been active in  the ongoing transfer window picking players who can add value to their respective squads. "Our target is to make sure that we succeed to retain the three titles we won last season and also to stamp meaningful impact in the CAF Champions Cup contest," said Yanga's Information Officer Hassan Bumbuli. However, before witnessing the Community Shield encounter, Yanga fans will first see their new-look team playing an international friendly match to climax Wiki ya Mwananchi celebrations on August 6th at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium. The club announced that they will invite one of the reputable clubs on the continent to play the match while insisting that it will be a memorable experience to their members and fans.
