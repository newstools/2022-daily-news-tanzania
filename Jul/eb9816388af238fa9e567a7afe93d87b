THE Uganda Cabinet has approved the implementation of the 21st EAC Summit directive in Uganda to adopt Kiswahili as an official language of the community. According to Uganda’s Government post on Twitter, the East African member state has also made the widely spoken language in the bloc as a compulsory subject in both primary and secondary schools. In September 2019, the government of Uganda endorsed the establishment of the Uganda National Kiswahili Council whose main objective is to guide the introduction of Kiswahili as the second national (official) language. Article 137 of the Treaty for the Establishment of the EAC provides that English shall be the official language of the Community while Kiswahili will be developed as a lingua franca of the Community. The East African Legislative Assembly passed a resolution to adopt Kiswahili as an official language of the Community.
