THE Tanzania Premier League Board (TPLB) has envisioned a bright 2022/23 season saying the ongoing five-day referees training will enhance officiating efficiency. The board's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Almasi Kasongo made the remarks on Friday in the city insisting that it is their responsibility to provide refreshing courses to referees. "These are people who interpret the 17 laws governing football as such; they ought to be given refresher courses regularly in order to keep them updated on what the modern football requires," Kasongo said. Adding, he said football laws keep on changing to suit the current world as such; the frequent training equips officials with the new changes, thereby nobody can be left behind. Moreover, Kasongo said the training is not only for Premier League referees but also those who take charge of the Championship as well as First League. He added they are compelled to have such trainings four times in one season, all of them, aimed to make referees improve their efficiency on the pitch. Moreover, the TPLB boss disclosed that beneficiaries of the course will be given exams at the end so that those who perform well will be given green light to officiate league matches." "No referee will be allowed to officiate the league match if he or she fails the exams and this is according to the guidelines. "They will conduct fitness and law interpretation tests and they have to pass in both of them in order to qualify to officiate the league matches in the coming season," he said. Already, the board declared that the 2022/23 NBC Premier League season will kick off on August 17th when the first set of league matches will be played at different venues across the country. However, the Community Shield match which inaugurates the new season, will be staged on August 13th pitting Young Africans against Simba at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in the city. It will be a replica of last season whereby Simba suffered a 1-0 loss.
