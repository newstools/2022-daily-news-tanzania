The Parliamentary Budget Standing Committee has said that the government should continue providing incentives to investors to attract new investments and encourage the expansion of businesses. The Committee’s Chairman, Daniel Sillo said, however that the government should monitor closely how the incentives are used to produce the expected results. “The government should continue putting various attractions for investors and monitor them, whether they were used properly and have shown positive results for the country's economic growth,” he said in Dodoma, yesterday at the briefing on the procedures in issuing tax incentives to investors. The Deputy Minister for Investment, Industry and Trade, Mr Exaudi Kigahe told the Budget Standing Committee that government will continue to improve and create a friendly environment focusing on tax incentives to stimulate investment in the country. He said the government would improve various areas of the economy, increase employment, earn foreign exchange, conduct international trade and boost the economy. He assured the Budget Standing Committee that his ministry would act on all the comments they made to encourage and attract local and foreign investors to build a sustainable economy. “All the recommendations you made aimed to improve tax incentives, setting appropriate taxes, strengthening management and evaluation of tax incentives offered will be considered," said Mr Kigahe noting the strategic identification and strengthening the protection of local investors will be given priority. Presenting the report to the Parliamentary Budget Standing Committee on the procedures of issuing tax incentives, the Director of Investment in the Ministry of Investment, Industry and Trade, Aristides Mbwasi said the government has through this initiative managed to register 42 smart investors’ projects worth 12.3 billion US dollars.
