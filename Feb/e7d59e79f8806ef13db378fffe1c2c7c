TANZANIA Commercial Bank (TCB) has opened its 82 branch in Mbinga, Ruvuma in its endeavour to reduce financial inclusion gap in the country. The Mbinga branch becomes the third to be opened by the bank in this year across mainland and isles, which is a strategy to catalyse the rate of growth of commercial and economic activities in Ruvuma—one of the leading region in maize production. The Tanzania Commercial Bank Chief Executive Officer, Mr Sabasaba Moshingi, said the lender’s customers should rest assured they are in safe hands, and called on Mbinga residents to utilise services offered—including loans and savings accounts. “TCB is dedicated to open branches in areas with vibrant economic activities which have the potential to spur growth of financial ativities for the people and in return raise their level of income,” Mr Moshingi said, which is the part of the lender’s efforts to bring banking services closer to the people. Mbinga branch is a continuation of the bank’s exercise to open branches this year, following the launch of two branches early this year in Kigamboni, Dar es Salam and Mpanda in Katavi. The Ruvuma Regional Commissioner, Brig General Wilbert Ibuge, said TCB capitalised on Mbinga abundant opportunities ranging from agriculture--maize, coffee, sesame, cashew nuts, groundnuts and legumes; coal, gold and gemstones mining. Brigadier General Ibuge challenged the district residents to grab the opportunities offered by TCB and opens bank accounts and utilise affordable loans. “This is our bank and we need to use it for our own benefit for it is the first bank to put priority to Ruvuma residents, this is the third branch that TCB has so far opened in Ruvuma,” said the Regional Commissioner. The bank is financial institution incorporated from the former Tanzania Postal Bank to TPB before merging with TIB Corporate Bank and Women Bank to form Tanzania Commercial Bank (TCB).
