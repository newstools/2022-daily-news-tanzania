Some of the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) brokers have forecast that the equity market’s bullish performance will continue throughout the first quarter of this year on the back of the recovery of economy from Covid-19 disruptions. They have it that the economic growth will subsequently trigger profitability among companies as depicted by the banking sector's fourth quarter financial results. Zan Securities Chief Executive Officer Raphael Masumbuko said the recovery of the economy will subsequently make companies relatively more profitable. For example, banks like NMB and CRDB have posted impressive performance. "We expect to see increased market activities in the stock exchange for the remainder of the first quarter of 2022, the equity prices are likely to increase in Q2 (2022) as companies begin to disclose their unaudited financials for the year ending 2021," Mr Masumbuko said in the brokerage firm weekly market wrap-ups. “With our sentiment relatively neutral, we see equity markets in a positive trajectory." CRDB share price increased by 4.84 per cent to close the last week trading at 325/- per share.
