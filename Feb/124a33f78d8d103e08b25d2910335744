THE Business Registration and Licensing Agency (BRELA) has urged Tanzanians to register trademarks and other services so that their businesses can be easily identified in the markets. BRELA Licence Officer, Saada Kilabula said this at the closure of the ‘Kamilisha’ 2022 campaign held in Dar es Salaam. “Most customers have registered only business names instead of registering trademarks and business name together,” she said adding this is why BRELA continues to provide such education to create more awareness. She said the trademarks represent a customer in his/her business, showing the unique differences between one business and another and many people have registered a unique name without knowing the significance of the trademark. "Trademarks are the signs that a trader creates to represent his/her business," she said. "We are inviting all citizens to register trademarks and other services available to our office as its benefits are legally recognized. The owner can sell it to someone else so that he/she can use it, or lease someone and use it temporarily, it also enables them to get government tenders because it is legally recognized," he said.
