BUKOBA District Commissioner, Mr Moses Machali has urged traders at the municipal market to ensure security is tightened especially during night to prevent arson attacks. He urged women entrepreneurs who sell food at the market to ensure their stoves are put off before closing their business. He made the remarks on Wednesday during a meeting with Bukoba traders, which he convened to discuss various issues. “We should take necessary precaution to avoid fire tragedies especially during the night. Each one of us has a duty to safeguard the complex,” he said. Mr Machali also advised shop owners to make regular checks on their buildings’ electrical installations, noting that some of the installations needed re-fixing as they were fixed more than five years ago. Meanwhile, Kagera Regional Commissioner (RC), Major Gen Charles Mbuge has directed District Commissioners (DCs) and District Executive Directors (DEDs), to tighten internal revenue collections and directed them to register traders in their respective areas and submit the list to his office. He issued the directives following a probe team report formed by the Bukoba District Commissioner (DC) Moses Machali, which among other things, unveiled loss of millions of tax-payers money under the Bukoba Municipal Council. The RC handed the report to the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) for more investigations and directed the institution to take legal measures against the suspects. However, Mr Mbuge said initial reports indicated that about 321m/- was missing from government accounts system  and was not properly deposited. He however said it was still premature to speculate whether the money was swindled.  He explained that the Bukoba Municipal Council Trade Development Officer, identified as Richard Kubona, had been suspended to facilitate smooth investigation. The RC said all business licences should be properly recorded under the government accounting system.
