Manchester United has announced a landmark multi-year partnership which will see Tezos, one of the world’s most advanced and sustainable blockchains, featured on the Club’s range of men’s and women’s training kits. According to United’s official website manutd.com, Tezos-branded training kit will be worn by the first team squad for the first time prior to this weekend’s match against Southampton, introducing Manchester United fans to the partnership and Web3 technology through the Tezos blockchain.
Tezos is at the forefront of the global blockchain revolution which allows for fast, secure and efficient digital interactions without the need for intermediaries.
An original proof-of-stake blockchain, Tezos was built with an energy-efficient design that allows it to operate in a cleaner and more environmentally friendly way than other blockchains.
Tezos is also different to other blockchains in that it can seamlessly evolve, with regular updates designed and approved by its global community of users and developers.
