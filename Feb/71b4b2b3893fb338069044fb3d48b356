ORECORP Tanzania (OreCorp) has handed over three classrooms to Sengerema District, in Mwanza to improve learning environment in the country’s schools. OreCorp’s Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Yates and Chief Operating Officer, Henk Diederichs, travelled from OreCorp group head office in Australia to attend the handover ceremony held yesterday at the district. They said that the handover comes at a critical time for the company following the granting of a Special Mining Licence last December to Sotta Mining Corporation Limited (SMCL), a joint venture between the Government of Tanzania (16 per cent) and OreCorp (84 per cent), to develop the 670bn/- Nyanzaga Gold Project south of Ngoma in the Sengerema District. The project is now on track to be the first large scale gold mine to be built in Tanzania in over a decade and the first ever large scale mine in the Sengerema. OreCorp’s Tanzanian General Manager Damien Valente stated that, “OreCorp is proud of its continued support to providing our children with a safe and comfortable environment in which to learn and further their studies.” The construction of the three new classrooms is the latest in several community enhancing projects OreCorp has completed, since taking over management of the Project in 2015. Last July, OreCorp provided 26m/-for the construction of washrooms and desks at Ngoma Secondary School and the Company has been active in several community building initiatives throughout the district including providing 45m/-for the construction of the new Ngoma Police Station in April 2021. Once successfully developed, the Project will produce 200,000 ounces (six tonnes) of gold per annum for an initial 12 years and will cost an estimated 670bn/- to build.
