CHILDREN in Crossfire (CiC)-a nongovernmental organisation that works to promote and protect the rights of children caught in the crossfire of extreme poverty, have announced a ground breaking new programme on Early Childhood Development (ECD) worth 2.5 million pound (about 7.56bn/-). The huge financial support from Conrad N. Hilton Foundation is expected to see CiC play an instrumental role and growing ECD activities across the country for the next three years, starting January this year. According to press release issued by CiC Executive Director, Mr Richard Moore, Children in Crossfire will now lead a partnership with the Tanzanian Early Childhood Development Network (TECDEN) and Union of Tanzanian Press Clubs (UTPC) to help achieve the government’s goals. Dubbed Mtoto Kwanza (a Swahili version for A Child First), this major programme will build civic society’s capacity to ensure that every child in the country develops to their full potential. Announcing the new ambitious programme, CiC’s Executive Director, Mr Moore thanked Conrad Hilton N. Foundation for the grant issued saying their support was a powerful vindication of all the hard work done by CiC in Tanzania for nearly 15 years. President and CEO of the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, Mr Peter Laugharn said that CiC’s vision of a compassionate world where every child can realize their full potential was one that resonates so deeply with the values and vision of the Foundation. “One of the primary objectives for Global Early Childhood Development initiative is to ensure young children are developmentally on track” the CEO said adding; CiC has been active in this space in Tanzania for many years and is a wellrespected partner of the local government. We hope this grant will lead to an increase in both focus and resources for young children and lead toward the delivery of sustainable systems that support optimal child development”
