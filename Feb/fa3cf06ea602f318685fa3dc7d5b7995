THE government has developed a special strategy aimed at supporting development of the small-scale miners in the country including Njombe Region. Deputy Minister for Minerals, Dr Stephen Kiruswa made the statement in the Parliament, when responding to a question by Njombe Member of Parliament, Deodatus Mwanyika. In his main question, the lawmaker sought to know when the government will start supporting artisanal miners in Njombe as it is doing in other areas. The deputy Minister responded that the government through the State Mining Corporation (STAMICO) had prepared the strategy to be implemented in this fiscal year, adding that the plan consists of a year-long training programme, which will be conducted nationwide and go alongside engaging the small-scale miners through the representation of their associations (FEMATA). The training will be issued by various institutions including the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), Minerals Commission and district councils. "We also implement the strategy by educating and connecting the artisanal miners with financial institutions and STAMICO has already entered into agreements with the banks such as CRDB bank, NMB bank and KCB bank to enable the miners to access capital and low interest loans," Mr Mwanyika pointed out. He said the corporation has also entered into a pact with the Geological Survey of Tanzania (GST) to help the miners get required information on sediments in their areas, before they start excavations. "We are also working to get enough mining equipment that are specifically for small-scale miners to help them conduct their extraction activities well," added the legislator. He further said that the government was committed and striving to make sure that minerals benefit the people, raise their incomes and as well boost government revenues.
