A US woman whose boyfriend killed her son while she was at work has been sentenced to 16 months in jail. Rebecca Hogue, 29, was convicted in November of the first-degree murder of her two-year-old son Ryder, under Oklahoma's "failure to protect" laws. A jury recommended she be sentenced to life in prison, but a judge has suspended the sentence to 16 months. It means she will spend 13 months behind bars, due to time already served. Speaking at her sentencing, Hogue said she would do anything to go back and prevent her son's death. "I was so proud of having such a beautiful, strong, smart, healthy child," Hogue said, according to the Norman Transcript. "The only thing in two years that has brought me peace is that the man who did this is dead. I know my child is in heaven and that [former boyfriend Trent] is nowhere near him." Sentencing Hogue, Judge Michael Tupper told her she did "not deserve to die in prison". "You are not a monster," the judge continued. "You have value and you have worth." SOURCE: BBC
