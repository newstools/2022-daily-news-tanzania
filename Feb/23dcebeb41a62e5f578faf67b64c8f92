THE money market analysts have predicted yields increase and oversubscription for the 182 and 364 days Treasury bills, which goes under the hammer today. The government wants to raise to 1.0bn/- using a Treasury bill of 35 days, 1.7bn/- for 91 days, 3.0bn/- for 182 days and 72.7bn/- for 364 days at today’s auction. Vertex International Securities said in its Weekly Market Review that they expect the auction to post a decrease in yields and oversubscription, especially for the senior T-bills. “We forecast a price decrease, increase in yields and oversubscription in this week’s bills auction, especially for the 182–day and 364–day,” a Vertex report said. This year has started with a big change occurring in Treasury yields—though for long tenure debt instruments. Zan Securities said in its Weekly Market Wrap-Ups that the long end of the curve continues to fall substantially and the overall curve has slightly adjusted downwards. “As we forecasted in our previous reports low yields on 20 and 25 bond will cause a perpetual shift towards 15-year bond also causing its yield to fall as seen during this week’s re-opening auction,” Zan said adding: “Pessimism about yields might diverge focus to the equity market mostly.” Orbit said in its Weekly Market Synopsis that the government through the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) has successfully raised 393.17bn/- in January through bonds and bills.
