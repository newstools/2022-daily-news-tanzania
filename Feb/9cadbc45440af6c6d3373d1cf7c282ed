NMB Bank has been granted a certificate of appreciation for its contribution to the establishment of the Zanzibar Maisha Bora Foundation (ZMBF) which focuses on rural underprivileged women, girls, and children especially in promoting nutrition and supporting women engaging in marine activities such as seaweed farming. The Head of Government Business Unit at NMB, Vicky Bishubo said here at the weekend during the launch of ZMBF founded by the Zanzibar First Lady Maryam Mwinyi that the bank is committed to supporting the government efforts to boost the blue economy. “NMB has been in the frontline to support Zanzibar government in growing the blue economy and today we are supporting the Zanzibar First Lady’s charitable organisation,” she said. She said during the launch of the charitable organisation, NMB contributed cash and items like tracksuits and t-shirt to the participants of the six kilometres march from Boutros Ghali to Mao Zedong grounds. Ms Bishubo said also that NMB recently supported the Zanzibar International Marathon during which it collaborated with the Zanzibar Association of Tour Operators (ZATO) to launch electronic cards for tourists. The ZMBF priority areas are in line with the blue economy agenda, national programmes, Isles vision 2050, and the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adding that women and girls interested in marine resources would be trained on better fishing and production of seaweed methods
