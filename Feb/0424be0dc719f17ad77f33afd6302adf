TANZANIA Revenue Authority (TRA) in Rukwa region has called on the public to ensure they demand receipts for every product and service purchased so as to address tax evasion loopholes in the market. The TRA Rukwa Regional Manager,Mr Frederick Kanyilili said here yesterday that the call was important because it has been the practice of some dishonesty traders to evade paying taxes on various goods. “The regional revenue authority has embarked on campaign to uncover traders who are not ready to go for tax compliance,several dishonest traders have already been arraigned into court,” he said He emphasized that basicallya trader who does not issue a receipt or who issues a receipt for less amount or a buyer who does not ask for a receipt – all deserve punishment for participating in denying the government revenue. “By deliberately refraining from issuing receipts or issuing receipts that state lower prices instead of real one sold one denies the government of its right revenue. This is an offence definitely, if found an individual is liable to a fine of between 3m/- to 4m/- or be arraigned in court if an individual persists disobeying,” he insisted. He explained that similarly for a buyer who does not ask for a receipt with shall be fined between 30,000/- to 1.5m/- depending on the value of goods procured. Mr Kanyilili elaborated that TRA has been compelled to imposefine on buyers in efforts to instill a culture of demanding a receipt every time one procures goods since that his/her right and will equally help the government collect proper taxes from the traders. "I emphasize the need for every trader to pay tax… with a lot of collected revenue the government will be able to execute its various public development projects,” he further explained. Meanwhile, Rukwa Regional TRA's Legal Officer, MrAthumanMruma told reporters that already seven traders based in Sumbawanga municipality have been arraigned and charged for committing various crimes.
