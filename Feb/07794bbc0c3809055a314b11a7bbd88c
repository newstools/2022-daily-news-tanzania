The State run utility--Tanzania National Electric Supply Company (Tanesco) announced on Friday that it has completed its work on Ubungo III and Kinyerezi I gas--powered stations. The completion of the tasks is a relief to Tanesco customers who have experienced almost ten days of power interruption in most parts of the country. Tanesco’s spokesperson, Martin Mwembene, told reporters in Dar es Salaam that the country now has self-sufficient gas to generate the needed electricity. The corporation had announced it was undertaking major adjustments at the two power stations to boost power supply from 150 megawatts to 335 megawatts-- a plan that subsequently resulted in some places receiving partial electricity supply.
