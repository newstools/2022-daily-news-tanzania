Gunmen have attacked Libyan Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah’s convoy in the capital, Tripoli, according to sources, hours before the eastern-based parliament is due to convene to elect a new prime minister. The attack took place early on Thursday as the interim leader was returning home, the sources told Al Jazeera, calling it an “assassination attempt”. One of the bullets penetrated the windscreen of the prime minister’s car, but he and his driver escaped unhurt. Libya’s chief prosecutor has launched an investigation into the attack, according to the sources. The prime minister’s office has yet to release a statement. Source: Al Jazeera
