KAGERA Sugar's Assistant Coach, George Kavila says he banks on the former Simba and Young Africans striker, Hamis Kiiza ‘Diego' to play a key role in his team's performance at the attacking area. He said with Kiiza he is sure the team's target to finish at the top-four position in the Premier League will be attained. Kavila, the former Kagera sugar skipper, said the arrival of the Ugandan international, Kiiza can add something to their squad. Kavila said Kiiza was signed by Kagera Sugar in a mini-transfer window on a two- year contract as a free agent after finishing his contract with the Ugandan Premier League side, Proline FC. "Kiiza is very familiar with Tanzanian football and has played for Simba and Yanga so his experience will give them something to learn from the player. "His presence will add something he is experienced with, he will add something to the youth,’’ he said. He said other young players will learn from him because he has played for all the big teams in Tanzania. Kavila also congratulated his players for their two consecutive wins; 2-1 against Dodoma jiji FC at Jamhuri stadium in Dodoma before their wonder 1-0 win over champions Simba at Kaitaba stadium in Kagera. He added they now focus on getting good results in the second round of the league to achieve their target of finishing in top positions. Kagera Sugar will play against Coastal Union at Kaitaba stadium tomorrow. After Coastal Union, they will have two away matches against Police Tanzania at Ushirika Stadium in Kiliman- jaro and Young Africans at the Mkapa stadium. After playing against Yanga, they will return to Kaitaba stadium to play against Namungo. Kagera Sugar are placed ninth after 13-game outings. They have won four, lost five and drawn four matches. They have netted 13 and con- ceded 11 goal.
