Nigerian Vice-President Yemi Osibanjo will today grace African Court on Human and People’s Rights judicial year. According to a statement by the Arusha-based court, the high-profile ceremony will also be attended by representatives of Member States, Regional and Sub-Regional Courts, African Union organs with a human rights mandate, African Union Ambassadors accredited to Tanzania, members of the judicial corps of Tanzania, representatives of Bar Associations, civil society organisations, members of the academia and other stakeholders involved in the work of the Court and the protection of human rights on the continent. The event will be run virtually to give all Africans the opportunity to be part of Africa’s apex court solemn event. The Court is composed of eleven Judges, nationals of Member States of the African Union elected in their individual capacity. It was established by African countries to ensure the protection of human and peoples’ rights in Africa. The Court officially started its operations in November 2006 initially in Addis Ababa and a year later moved to its permanent seat in Arusha, Tanzania. It has jurisdiction over all cases and disputes submitted to it concerning the interpretation and application of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights and any other relevant human rights instrument ratified by the States concerned. It also complements and reinforces the functions of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights. It meets four times a year in Ordinary Sessions and may hold Extra-Ordinary Sessions.
