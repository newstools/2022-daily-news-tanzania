THE European Union has allocated $170bn (£125bn) for investment in Africa for green and digital projects, along with health and education ahead of the EU and African Union (AU)’s two-day summit which has started today in Brussels, Belgium. Leaders from the African AU member states including President Samia Suluhu Hassan and their counterparts from EU bloc African Union (AU) and European Union (EU) are expected to ‘’strengthen relations’’ according. ‘’This sixth summit is an attempt to improve relations after disputes over coronavirus vaccines, illegal migration and the role of Russian mercenaries in Africa,’’ BBC reported on Thursday. What to expect at the 6th EU-AU Summit The summit is held amid tensions over the management of the COVID-19 pandemic and a recent wave of coups d’état in parts of Africa. According to Aljazeera, the two-day conference is expected to evolve from the donor-recipient dynamic that has often characterised post-colonial relations and instead deliver concerted solutions to global challenges including climate change. “What you want from Africa, you should also expect Africa to want from you,” Fred Ngoga Gateretse, head of the AU’s conflict prevention was quoted by Aljazeera. The Africa-EU Partnership was formally established in Cairo in 2000 and has been traditionally held every three years. The sixth edition, scheduled to follow Abidjan in 2017, was postponed for a year due to the pandemic.
