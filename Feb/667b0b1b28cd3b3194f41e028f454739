NEWLY elected Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, Mr Mussa Azzan Zungu, on Friday assured Mps of his cooperation with them in supervising public funds to bring positive impacts. Mr Zungu issued the pledge shortly after lawmakers elected him as the new Deputy Speaker, a position that was left vacant after resignation of Dr Tulia Ackson who has been elected the Speaker, filling the void left by Mr Job Ndugai who resigned. During the election yesterday, Mr Zungu was a sole candidate, thus Mps voted ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. Announcing the results, Speaker Dr Tulia said a total of 301 lawmakers voted. Mr Zungu got a total of 296 yes-votes while two were spoiled and three voted against him. Dr Tulia congratulated him for landslide victory and commended the Mps for having trust in him. Prior to election, Mr Zungu had an opportunity to speak before the voters, asked for votes and received questions from the MPs. Magu lawmaker, Mr Joseph Kusagwa (CCM) asked him what he would do to enable them (Mps) carry out their duties in the constituencies effectively. Reacting to the question, Mr Zungu said he would work as per House Standing Orders and directives given by the Speaker for improving relations among legislators within and outside the Parliament. He insisted that the 2020 version of the Standing Orders has identified roles of the Deputy Speaker and that he would stick on applying the document. Mr Zungu’s election to the post was after his party (CCM) nominated him last week to contest. The ruling CCM’s Central Committee sat and endorsed Mr Zungu out of 11 total members who sought the party’s green light to contest for the post. The name of Mr Zungu then got blessings from the party caucus, according to secretary of the caucus.
