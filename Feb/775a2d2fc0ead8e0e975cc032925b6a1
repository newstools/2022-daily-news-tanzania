THE government will invest over 230m/- in the construction of a terrace to obstruct salty water that enters Mjananza agricultural valley in Pemba, the House of Representatives heard here yesterday. Minister of State in the First Vice-President’s Office Dr Saada Mkuya Salum told the House that the National Environment Management Council’s Climate Change Fund-funded project is scheduled to start this month. She said the successful execution of the project will enable Mjananza residents to continue with their farming activities, smoothly. She was answering a question by Pandani Representative Professor Omar Fakih Hamad, who wanted to know the government efforts to protect farmers against invasive salty water from the ocean along the Eastern Pemba coastal belt. Minister Saada said Zanzibar, like many parts of the world, has been adversely affected by climate change, which leads to disasters like Tsunami, hurricanes, floods, droughts and excessive rains. She said the government is taking various measures to mitigate the effects of climate change, citing mangrove planting and construction of terraces along the cost as some of the initiatives.
