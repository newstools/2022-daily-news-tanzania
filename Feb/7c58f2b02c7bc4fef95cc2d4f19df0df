THE African Export-Import Bank (AFREXIM) and the Peoples' Bank of Zanzibar (PBZ) have signed an Agreement in which the former will inject $5m to support and boost Letter of Credit (L/C) confirmation guarantee facility for the traders engaged in import and export trade using the Isles-based bank. The agreement was signed by Mr Amr Kamel, the Deputy Executive Vice President, Business Development and Corporate Banking of AFREXIM Bank, and the Executive Director of the PBZ, Mr Muhsin Salim Masoud in the presence of other senior officers from both Banks. "We appreciate for the USD 5 million boost as I welcome members of the business community to come and utilize the opportunity," Mr Masoud said after the signing ceremony held at the PBZ Headquarters here, adding that the benefits of the LC Confirmation guarantee are many, particularly at this time of implementing the blue economy agenda. Mr Kamel who led a team to Zanzibar in response to a meeting with President Hussein Mwinyi in South Africa explained "We are here to explore areas of priorities in collaboration with Zanzibar. PBZ being one of our shareholders, we have decided to support boost LC for traders." He said that AFREXIM Bank has enabled the PBZ to get more funds for LC to provide trade financing and also support the need to increase their access to trade finance, and also effectively boost imports and exports with an open eye on the blue economy. President Mwinyi has repeatedly promised to work with private sector and development partners to support small and medium traders in the country so that they contribute much in the economic development which relies heavily on tourism and trade.
