THE government has ordered the Tanzania Building Agency (TBA) Mwanza Regional Manager to fast track construction of a Mother and Child building at the Sekou - Toure Regional Referral Hospital. The order was issued here recently by the Deputy Minister Works and Transport Mr Godfrey Kasekenya who was on a three –day official visit of the region to inspect various projects including roads infrastructures, the new Mv Mwanza ship, ferries and Mwanza International Airport. Mr Kasekenya said completion of the building would provide an opportunity for patients who use other facilities and medical services at the hospital to be moved to the new building.  He said the building, whose construction started in 2017 will have the capacity of 261 beds. He urged the Mwanza Regional Acting TBA Manager to complete construction of the building on time and hand it to the Ministry of Health who are the owner and users of the building so that the ministry can transfer patients and medical services to the new building. “In terms of construction, I am satisfied with the standards and quality and the building is really attractive and it will provide the best medical care to the pregnant women, children and other patients,” he said. The Acting TBA regional Manager, Moses Urio said he would implement the government directives as it was issued to him. Earlier, the Sekou-Toure Regional Referral Hospital Acting in charge Dr Bahati Msaki said the 10.1bn/- project once completed, will have two operating rooms, two- surgery rooms,  a delivery ward,  a maternity ward, a ward for children under five, pregnant women ward, doctor's rooms, dressing rooms,  management offices and receptions rooms.
