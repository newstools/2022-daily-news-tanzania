AZAM and Geita Gold have become the first teams to march into Azam Sports Federation Cup (ASFC) after producing victories in their last 16 fixtures. The Chamazi-based outfits were heavy winners on Friday as they defeated Baga Friends 6-0 to continue their perfect performance under coach Abdihamid Moallin. Geita Gold smiled at Sheikh Amri Abeid Stadium in Arusha after generating a slim 1-0 win over Mbuni. It was a relief for Geita Gold coach Felix Minziro to guide his side into the last eight as they waited for the draw to establish their next opponents. However, Azam’s Paul Peter became the first player in the round of 16 games to score a hattrick as he had a good day at office while Charles Zulu, Paul Katema and Daniel Amoah, each contributed one goal in their team’s massive win. The team’s goal-scoring machine Prince Dube was silent on the day as his scoring boots were blunt, but all in all, it was a great performance from the hosts. With Friday’s final results, it means the last eight phase will have no First League representatives as Baga Friends and their colleagues Mbuni were officially sent packing. Meanwhile, the fight for ASFC quarterfinals continues today when Coastal Union host Mtibwa Sugar at Mkwakwani Stadium in Tanga while at Kaitaba Stadium, Kagera Sugar will entertain Namungo. For Coastal Union, it will be another testing moment for their coach Melis Medo who has recently been under pressure from the team’s supporters who are not content with the trend of their side. As such; a win over Mtibwa Sugar will surely ease the pressure on him other than a negative outcome which will be salt on a fresh wound for the American coach. Another unpredictable battle will be at Kaitaba Stadium as both Kagera Sugar and Namungo have what it takes to push themselves into the last eight of the competition.
