SIMBA must apply extra use of skills, commitment and shrewd planning to get good results against RS Berkane in Morocco this Sunday as we rally behind them in their Confederation Cup mission. Putting into consideration there are six points up for grab, we pray for our envoys to win the Sunday game in Morocco and the return leg tie in Dar es Salaam two weeks later. We insist on those aspects as they play a big role in making our envoys reach their target of playing in the tournament’s semifinals. Simba have what it takes to win the away match against the Moroccan club because of the quality of their players and their experience in international competitions. Our envoys should feel proud of their status as one of the big clubs in the continent enriched by quality and experienced players from all corners of Africa. We urge players and the technical bench to work hard to enable the team win the tough encounter since it pays well for the country, the clubs and players who are engaged in the tough mission. But to achieve that we insist players and officials to work extremely hard to go beyond the group stage despite the fact none of their opponents deserves an underdog status. The importance of working hard and smartly lies in the fact that the standard of soccer in Africa is more or less the same from the south to the north and from the west to the east. Any team that is capable of playing at this stage is capable of winning matches be at home or away from home. With four points from two matches, we believe Simba can add three more points in Morocco by beating the hosts and this is achievable. While we insist of commitment, appropriate use of skills and fighting spirit as vital tools to success, we wish our envoys best luck.
