President Samia Suluhu Hassan is scheduled to inaugurate newly constructed Mwalimu Julius Nyerere Leadership School located at Kibaha in Coast region on February 23 this year. Samia who doubles as ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) chairperson will grace the institution which was established purposely to serve southern Africa in honour of the late founding President and former chairperson of the Frontline States, Julius Kambarage Nyerere. Coast Regional Commissioner, Aboubakar Kunenge revealed this in Dar es Salaam on Saturday as he asked Kibaha residents to show up for the historical event. The project has being completed thanks to funds from the Chinese government through the Communist Party of China (CPC), CCM and five southern Africa liberation parties, namely ANC (South Africa), Swapo (Namibia), MPLA (Angola), Zanu-PF (Zimbabwe) and Frelimo (Mozambique). Julius Kambarage Nyerere was born in Butiama, in northern Tanzania, on 13 April 1922 and died on 14 October 1999. Many visitors from the region and elsewhere make the journey to Butiama to visit his grave and to remember how he used his life to transform eastern and southern Africa. In July 2018, Tanzania’s fifth phase President Dr John Magufuli laid the foundation stone for the construction of the Mwalimu Nyerere Leadership School at Kibaha.
