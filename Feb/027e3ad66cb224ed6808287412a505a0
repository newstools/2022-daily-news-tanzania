PREPARATION for the Saanane Island Volleyball has clicked into top gear ahead of its final shootout this Sunday at Mirango Sports courts in Mwanza. Organised by the Mwanza based Home Life Sports (HOLIS), everything is in place ahead of the final, according to the organiser’s chairman Majaliwa Mayunga. He said the final match will involve Mwanza volleyball rivals St Augustine University (SAUT) and Mwanza Transit Camp (MTC) in the men’s final. He said the both teams have been in training intensively ready for the big show. However, Mayunga extended his gratitude to all sponsors who supported the event and make it a huge success. “We would like to thank our sponsors Tanzania National Parks Authority (TANAPA), Yubox Tv, Tecno, Jembe FM, and Blue Coast Investment Limited for making us prepare a successful volleyball tournament,” he added. He also urged volleyball fans in Mwanza to come in big numbers to cheer up the teams during the final. Mayunga noted noted they expect a tough final as both teams have quality players who also are in good form. Mayunga added that HOLIS is committed to support the growth of the game in the country. He said the event is also part of the promotion of sports tourism at the Saanane Island National Park which is located on the Lake Victoria. “We want to make this event grow to the next level though it remains open for Mwanza based teams,”Mayunga said. HOLIS is also the organiser of an East Africa Volleyball Competition that draws top East African teams. The EAC event is an ideal platform for local teams to challenge teams from all countries of region. “Home Life is committed to support the development of volleyball in Tanzania, we do programmes from the grassroots too,” he said.
