The factory has also set up a factory to recycle plastic bottles, even colored ones whose collection has been challenging; I direct them to ensure that their bottles return to them for recycling and manufacture other products in order to protect our environment. ” He said that, industries have great contribution in promoting economic growth as well   as contributing to direct employments assuring that the government will ensure that compliance with the environmental laws.
