More than 100 people have died in landslides and flash flooding in the Brazilian city of Petrópolis, officials say. The city, which is located in the mountains north of Rio de Janeiro, was hit by torrential rainfall. Houses in hillside neighbourhoods were destroyed and cars swept away as floodwaters raced through the city's streets. Search and rescue teams are combing the mud for survivors. Brazil's National Civil Defence said that 24 people had been rescued alive by Wednesday night local time. Videos shared on social media showed extensive damage and vehicles floating in the streets. "The situation is almost like war... Cars hanging from poles, cars overturned, lots of mud and water still," Rio de Janeiro Governor Cláudio Castro told journalists. With more than 30 people reported missing, he said that the search and rescue efforts would continue non-stop. SOURCE: BBC
