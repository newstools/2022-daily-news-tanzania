President Samia Suluhu Hassan asked clerics to emphasize on the fear of God to their congregants in order to end killings in the society. The Head of State said members of society have forgotten God’s ways, a reason why some people are taking the lives of others. President Samia said this at Rulenge-Ngara Diocese Bishop Severine Niwemugizi’s Silver Jubilee of Episcopal Ordination (1997-2022) celebrations in Ngara District, Kagera where she attended as a guest of honour. “There is no religion that allows people to commit suicide or take another’s life; if you have faith in your heart you can’t take the life of another just because they cheated on you, or because of inheritance, wealth or anything else. No religion teaches that,” President Samia insisted. Equally, she also instructed traditional chiefs to play their roles by reminding people of their culture and traditions which emphasize on humanity. “The government will also work on the matter, we will start educating children from our schools…good enough we have the Civics subject, so we will start there,” the President stated On the other side, President Samia said in the 2021/2022 financial year more that 793m/- has been set aside for the construction of a big well in Ngara region. A total of 100m/- has initially been disbursed to execute the project.
