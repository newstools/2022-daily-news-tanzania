THE ruling party CCM has nominated Ilala Member of Parliament Mussa Azzan Zungu to run for the position of Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly. Before announcement in Dodoma on Tuesday, CCM national Chairperson and President Samia Suluhu Hassan presided over a special session of the Central Committee (CC) held at the party's headquarters in Dodoma. The committee endorsed Mr Zungu out of 11 total members, who sought the party's green light to contest for the post. The name of Mr Zungu then got blessings from the party caucus, according to Secretary of the caucus, Mr Rashid Shangazi. According to a statement issued by the office of the National Assembly Clerk over the weekend, Members of Parliament will cast their votes on Friday this week to elect the Deputy Speaker. This comes after the post became vacant following resignation of former Deputy Speaker Dr Tulia Ackson, who contested and won Speaker's slot. Dr Tulia was elected to the post after the resignation of former Speaker Job Ndugai, who served in the position for six years.
