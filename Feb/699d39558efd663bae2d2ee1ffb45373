TANZANIA Electricity Supply Company (Tanesco) in Rukwa Region has assured residents in the region that a 3.8bn/- worth 15MVA transformer project will be completed in April this year. Tanesco Rukwa Region Customer Relation Officer, Ms Tupokigwe Gwakisa said here over the weekend that upon completion of the project it will generate sufficient power to supply the whole region and some parts of Mlele District in the Katavi Region. The explanations came following an outcry of power rationing by participants of a one day training session organized by Rukwa Region-Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority - Customer Consultative Committee (EWURACCC). The training attended by street chairpersons and Ward Executive Officers (WEOs) from five wards in Sumbawanga municipality was held here in the municipality over the weekend.
