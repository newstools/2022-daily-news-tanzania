ZANZIBAR President Hussein Ali Mwinyi on Sunday challenged religious leaders and institutions to use their platforms to maintain country’s peace and unity, saying union and Zanzibar governments needed their contributions. President Mwinyi insisted that religious leaders and institutions have a key role to play in discouraging acts that could affect people’s welfare and disrupt peace such as corruption, theft, child and women abuse, drug abuse and others. “I call upon you to ensure that peace and unity is strengthened. Cooperate with both governments; union and Zanzibar, in realizing development targets…our governments need contributions from religious institutions and other development partners,” he emphasized when officiated opening of the regional Muslim forum on peace held in Dar es Salaam. The three-day forum with international status consisted of various Muslim leaders who convened to discuss various issues aimed at looking at a better means of educating the public over protecting peace. The educative forum with a theme: “Quaran and Sunnah: a life style and development,” focused on strengthening peace and faith in the region. “I assure you that both governments of union and Zanzibar will implement resolutions made from this forum,” President Mwinyi assured. He congratulated selection of the theme and a decision to organize the forum, arguing that it was crystal clear that Quran and Sunnah were main pilar for achievements.
