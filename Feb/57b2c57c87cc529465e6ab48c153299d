President Samia Suluhu Hassan has tasked the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) to strictly monitor and act on various development projects implemented in the country. Speaking on Monday shortly after laying a foundation stone for the clean water project in Bunda during her four day working visit in Mara region, the president said “it is useless for PCCB to wait until the fund is swindled for it to take action.” "Why wait for the Controller and Auditor General (CAG) performance reports?” the president asked, urging the anti-corruption bureau to act tough. Equally the President instructed Internal Auditors in the councils to work diligently by ensuring that they unearth all dubious acts on time. "Sometimes such faults are not revealed on time because internal auditors also share the public funds,” the President added.
