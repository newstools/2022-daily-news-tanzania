TANZANIAN striker Reliant Lusajo has an opportunity to stretch his 10- goal command at the helm of NBC Premier League top scorers' list if he scores for Namungo in their match against Geita Gold at Nyankumbu Stadium in Geita today. The Namungo ‘hitman’ is leaving no stone unturned as he clears his way towards the golden boot podium at the end of the season. If he succeeds to win the award, it will be his first time in his league career to claim that honour. He has had a perfect ride so far in the league after subduing the last season's top goal scorer John Bocco and his runners up Meddie Kagere, who have been unlucky this time though the race is far from over. If he scores today, he will continue to scale up the staircase towards the best scorer’s award as such; everything is within his reach to make sure that he keeps hold the opportunity and never let it go. However, Lusajo faces stiff challenge from Young African's striker Fiston Mayele and Geita Gold's hit-man George Mpole who have netted seven goals. Mayele increased his tally to seven goals after contributing one goal in their recent 2-0 win over Mtibwa Sugar on Wednesday at Manungu Complex in Morogoro. He can also add up the digit if he manages to score on Sunday in their match against Kagera Sugar at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam on Sunday. Polisi Tanzania's Vitalis Mayanga is third on the list with six goals and he could also increase his tally if he scores versus KMC at Azam Complex in Dar es Salaam tomorrow. On the fourth slot are Jeremiah Juma (Tanzania Prisons), Saido Ntibazonkiza (Yanga) and Meddie Kagere (Simba) with each netting 5 goals from 15 matches played in the first round of the league.
