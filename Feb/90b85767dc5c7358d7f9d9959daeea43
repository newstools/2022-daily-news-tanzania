Earlier, when welcoming Mr Sanka, the Assistant Registrar of Cooperatives in the Kilimanjaro region, Ms Jacqueline Senzighe, urged co-operative leaders to stop clinging to power especially when their respective terms of leadership is over. “There are leadership tenures which have been set by laws governing the cooperative movement in the country when the leaders’ legal tenure comes to an end, it is better for a co-operative to Union entity to hold another election without any delay”, she said. “There are many opportunities that a co-operative society or Union may miss just because they have failed to conduct their legal elections on time and by the law, therefore members of co-operative societies and Unions should be educated on these issues in advance to avoid the possible consequences caused by failing to conduct their elections”. In his thanking remarks on behalf of the new leaders, the new KNCU (1984) Ltd Chairman Mr Ndossi, said he and his team have significant responsibilities which included restoring the dignity of Africa’s oldest co-operative institution in Africa.
