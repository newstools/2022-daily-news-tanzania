A BANK of Tanzania (BoT) officer has cautioned people against keeping large sums of cash at home, saying the practice is dangerous. The BoT Manager of Currency, Ilulu Ilulu said in Mbeya City recently that while there may be certain benefits to holding a small amount of cash at home for whatever purpose, there were risks involved in doing so, particularly if it is a large amount of money. “The greater the amount of cash at home, the greater the risks involved which include fire, loss or theft,” he said at a seminar for journalists organised by BoT in Mbeya. He said keeping a small amount of cash at home was okay but large amount of cash should be in a bank, where it will be protected against the threats that have the greatest probability of happening. He said there were plenty of horror stories of people who lost huge sums of money kept at home due to fire outbreaks or theft.
“We can’t discourage this habit strongly enough. That’s a recipe for problems down the road. “Keeping money stashed around the house leaves you at tremendous risk of theft or loss due to fire or some sort of unforeseen disaster,” he said. About 65 per cent of the adult population in Tanzania is formally financially included, with mobile financial services contributing to 60 per cent of usage compared to other channels, according to FinScope survey of 2017. The survey showed that though most Tanzanians who save still save at home, a significant increase in the proportion of those who save using their mobile phones could be observed. As well as the increase in mobile wallets, there is also an increase in membership of informal savings groups. Quick access and safety of money were the main drivers for their choice of savings channels. Official records show by August 2021 there were 48 licenced banks in Tanzania which included 35 commercial banks, five community banks, four microfinance banks, two mortgage banks, and 2 development banks.
