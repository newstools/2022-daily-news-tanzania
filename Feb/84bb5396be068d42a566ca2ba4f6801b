TANZANIA Women Chamber Of Commerce (TWCC) is staging Women Industrial Week fair early next month in Dar es Salaam. The exhibition will also be used as a platform to award best exhibitors, among others, at a separate event to be held a day after the fair ends. The TWCC Chairperson Ms Mercy Sila challenged women to participate in the fair’s second edition that will acknowledge women who played important economic roles to develop societies around them and the nation at large. “Women are such important organs for the growth and sustainability of any society, and there are tangible and positive economic impacts a woman can bring about when trusted and given opportunities to prove themselves” Ms Mercy said. The women chamber will use the Women Industrial Week to evaluate themselves, and hence create plans to sustain their businesses. These awards main aim is to acknowledge and honour important roles played by both successful and emerging women in industry and trade sectors.
