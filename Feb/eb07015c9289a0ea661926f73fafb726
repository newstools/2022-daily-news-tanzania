NATIONAL Assembly Speaker Tulia Ackson yesterday told the parliamentary standing committee chairpersons and their deputies to spearhead the fight against corruption and public office abuses. “The public expect of you to be the mirror in adhering to the leadership ethics; observe the boundaries of your authorities,” Dr Tulia said in her speech to open the five-day training for the committee leaders at Bunge’s Tunguu sub-office. He reminded the training participants of the role of the legislature as the bridge between the government and wananchi. “It’s our responsibility to ensure that issues brought before our committees focus on President Samia Suluhu Hassan’s priorities,” the newly elected head of the legislative pillar of the government said. Dr Tulia challenged Members of Parliament to engage their voters and get their views before speaking in the house. “…Yes, you were elected to represent them (voters) but that doesn’t mean you own their thinking too…engage wananchi, take their views for effective representation,” she counseled. The speaker implored the leaders to nurture close relationship and collaboration if they have to succeed in their responsibilities. She reminded the committee leaders to use their authority wisely, “Treat members of your committees with respect; accord them the respect they deserve…let’s remember that these (members) are parliamentarians like us.” Former Speakers Pius Msekwa, Anne Makinda and Zanzibar House of Representatives former Speaker Pandu Ameir Kificho are scheduled to lecture the committee leaders.
