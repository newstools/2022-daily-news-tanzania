MWANZA Regional Immigration Department arrested more than 600 illegal immigrants last year, pledging to come up with effective strategies to control influx of people crossing the country's borders illegally. This was revealed on Saturday in Mwanza City by the Regional Immigration Officer (RIO) Mr Peter Mbaku, while briefing journalists on the performance report of the regional office for 2021/2022. He said last year a total of 660 illegal immigrants were arrested breaking the figure as Burundians being 263, and the rest from China, Congo DRC, Egypt, India, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, adding that some 12 escaped from Kigoma refugee camps. Mr Mbaku said that 246 illegal refugees were deported, 57 were brought to justice and 76, who escaped from the camps were returned to Nduta, Mtendeli and Nyarugusu camps. He added that 77 refugees were ordered to pay for permits or special passports after being found illegally staying in Mwanza.  Those who applied for passport were 1,655 and those issued with temporary ones were 1,549. The immigration department regional officer said they will conduct public education through community radio and newspapers among others so that people can understand that it is against the law to host illegal immigrants and engage in human trafficking. He added that the education will also be provided on the streets, to the auxiliary police  and participate  in various exhibitions, which will be held in Mwanza region with the aim of educating the public on the importance of cooperating with the department to address the problem. "I urge Tanzanians to refrain from engaging in the crime of trafficking illegal immigrants into the country, because it is a legal offense to also take/engage any refugee from the camp in any business in the country," said Mr Mbaku. Equally, Mr Mbaku urged people in the region to continue cooperating with their department to fight illegal immigrants, because they pose security threat to the country.
