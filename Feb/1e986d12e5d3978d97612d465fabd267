He  said the deceased was a housewife, who resided at Kanyara Ward, Geita District. "Angella and her husband lived with a six-month-old baby and her husband works at Geita Gold Mine (GGML).

"When the house's door was opened by other means, the woman was found hanging in the kitchen.” Meanwhile, the RPC reported that Ginasa Petro (30), a farmer from Bariadi District in Shinyanga Region died after eating rat poison.

"On January 29 this year, the deceased requested his wife to return home but his wife didn't show any positive response. Investigations on the incident are in progressing, he said and the bodies of the two deceased were handed to relatives for burial after medical examination.
