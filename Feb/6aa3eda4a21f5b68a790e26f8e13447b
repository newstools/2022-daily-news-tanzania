Simba SC have suspended winger Bernard Morrison until disciplinary matters involving the player and the Msimbazi based giants are resolved. A press statement issued by the club and shared on the club’s verified twitter account (@SimbaSCTanzania), on Friday, claimed that the player usually gets away from the camp without permission. “Last time, Morrison escaped from the camp and was directed by the technical bench team not to return until he met the club’s chief executive officer Barbara Gonzalez,” the statement said. It added: “But the player refused and continued staying out of the camp.” The club has tasked Morrison to explain in writing over the saga and failure to do so, according to the statement, “more disciplinary measures will be taken.”
