THE Small Industries Development Organisation (SIDO) has been advised to be more creative and start exploring alternatives in beefing up its development fund rather than solely depending on the government. SIDO’s National Entrepreneurship Development Fund (NEDF) started with a seed capital of 6.6bn/- in 1994/95 and the fund size increased to 9.7bn/- in 2020/21, equivalent to 46.9 per cent in almost 30 years ago. The snail-pace of increasing of the fund size that enables people in urban and rural areas to start small businesses is seen as holding back efforts to create small scale industries. The Vice Chairman of the Parliamentary Permanent Committee for Industry, Trade and Environment, Erick Shigongo advised SIDO to look for alternative and innovative way to increase the fund size to reach many in need of affordable loans in rural areas. “SIDO should find ways to increase the fund's capital,” said Mr Shigongo during the presentation of the National Entrepreneurship Development Fund (NEDF) implementation report to the committee, over the weekend in Dodoma. He said SIDO should also look on specific categories, operating structure, loan amount, credit criteria, and interest rates on loans and funding for entrepreneurial groups. The Minister for Investment, Industry and Trade, Dr Ashatu Kijaji assured the committee that they would act on the recommendations made to ensure SIDO increase the fund size and capitalized in the NEDF to accelerate the establishment and growth of small industries in the country to increase employment and boost trade and economy. The Deputy Minister for Investment, Industry and Trade, Mr Exaud Kigahe, said it was important to support SIDO to increase capital in the NEDF through various sources of funding including collaboration with public institutions so that the fund benefits more citizens in terms of capital for setting up small industries. Earlier, SIDO Director General Prof Sylvester Mpanduji said that the fund received 6.6bn/- in 1994/1995 as seed capital which increased to 9.7bn/- in 2020/21.
