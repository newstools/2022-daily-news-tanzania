SERENGETI Breweries Limited (SBL) has reiterated its support in addressing challenges facing local farmers ranging from lack of markets, inadequate knowledge on modern farming methods to capital availability required to undertake commercial farming. The company, through its ambitious initiative known as agribusiness programme is currently assisting around 400 farmers across the country to overcome these challenges by providing them with free quality seeds, links to financial institutions to access credit facilities, basic training on entrepreneurship skills, as well as buying their produce at prices above market rates. The SBL Managing Director, Mark Ocitti, said in Dar es Salaam yesterday at an event to award scholarships to a group of 102 students pursuing diploma level agricultural courses in local colleges, which he said was yet another intervention by the company to strengthen the agricultural sector. So far, the company has extended a total of 208 scholarships in three years to support students coming from agricultural communities across the country, the MD said. “The increasing number of Kilimo Viwanda scholarships recipients, which goes hand in hand increased resourcing by SBL towards the programme, is a clear demonstration of our commitment to the wellbeing of the local communities and the development of Tanzania’s agricultural sector,” he said. Mr Ocitti added, “This programme covers all academicrelated expenses, including school fees for the entire study period – which is primarily two to three years for diploma level agricultural courses,” Ocitti said further that the programme also embodies SBL’s inclusion and diversity agenda that seeks to empower and give an equal opportunity to marginalized groups in society with a special focus on women and Persons with Disabilities. It is for this reason that 50 per cent of the 102 of Kilimo Viwanda scholarships recipients this year are female students and some being Persons with Disabilities. The Kilimo Viwanda scholarship already sponsors students in four colleges such as St. Maria Goretti from Iringa, Kaole Wazazi from Bagamoyo, Igabiro from Bukoba and Kilacha college from Moshi.
