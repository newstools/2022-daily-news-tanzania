President Samia Suluhu Hassan has revealed the government’s intentions to build more modern markets in Dar es Salaam Region, where a huge amount of money has been set aside for execution of mega project at Jangwani. At a meeting with petty trader representatives held Tuesday in the State House, Dar es Salaam, the President said although the government has allowed petty traders at Karume to resume their business at a recently razed Karume market plans are still underway to turn the area into a modern business center. “A lot of money has been released to fund the construction of Kariakoo market. Up next, we intend to construct the Jangwani area. I instruct the Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner [Amosi Makalla] to start searching for a constructor to begin the work," the President said. Meanwhile the Head of State gave various instructions to Directors, Ministries and authorities to the support of petty traders and hold regular meeting with the group to discuss on how to improve business environments. She directed the Ministry of Labour, Youth, Employment and Persons with Disability to formulate a petty traders policy as she promises to support the petty traders since their success held the nation to cut down the rate of unemployment in the country. On another development she also ordered the District Executive Directors to formulate special plans that will enable petty traders to benefit from 10 per cent loans set aside for special groups.
