PRESIDENT Samia Suluhu Hassan’s administration plans to publish updates on the number of jobs created in the country as it moves to confront the unemployment rate currently projected to stand at 9.4 percent. The president announced in Pemba on Friday, her administration has been able to create around 14,000 jobs in less than a year. “The government is aware of the employment problem and is striving to create more opportunities for the youth to find their way into the employment market,” President Samia said. She categorically said the new jobs created are those under the central government, strategic projects, the army and corporations. President Samia admitted that some of the youth have moved to establish their own businesses further creating jobs for others. She assured that her government will start releasing estimates of jobs created in the country. She did not itemize, however, whether the updates would be quarterly or annually.
