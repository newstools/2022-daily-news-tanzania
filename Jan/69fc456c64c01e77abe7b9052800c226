It is Zanzibar Revolution Day. For the 58th year, Zanzibaries and Tanzanians, in general, united on Wednesday to celebrate the occasion with enthusiasm at the national stadium, where defense and security forces conducted a grand parade followed by traditional dances from both the Isles and Mainland.

Zanzibar President Dr Hussein Mwinyi and Union President Samia Suluhu Hassan graced the event where residents of Unguja and Pemba gathered in large numbers.
