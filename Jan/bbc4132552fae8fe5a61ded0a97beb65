ZANZIBAR President Hussein Mwinyi has commended Prime Kassim Majaliwa, for the great achievements made in addressing challenges that were facing the Union. During the talks held at the Zanzibar State House, President Mwinyi commended the Prime Minister’s good management of the sessions which led to resolving a number of issues in the Union. Eleven out of 18 challenges have already been resolved. “We thank you for the fruitful dialogues on strengthening the Union,” Dr Mwinyi said, as he thanked the Union President Samia Suluhu Hassan for promoting good relations and supporting Zanzibar including providing funds from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to improve social services in the country. He said that the Union government has been instrumental in strengthening the economy of Zanzibar. “We are happy with the level of cooperation we get from the Union government, which is a prerequisite for smooth growth of the economy on both sides,” he said. President Mwinyi also informed the Premier that the ongoing peace and political stability remain key to economic recovery that was hit by the effects of Covid-19. He said that Zanzibar is achieving its development goals gradually, as it implements blue economy policy. “The impact of Covid-19 has been huge on the economy, but fortunately, tourists are increasing and thus boost revenue. Our economy majorly relies on tourism,” Dr Mwinyi said. In response, Mr Majaliwa thanked the Zanzibar President for working hard to pro- pel the Zanzibar economy. In the course, he assured Dr Mwinyi of solidarity as he continued to deliberate on Union matters to eliminate the remaining vexes.
