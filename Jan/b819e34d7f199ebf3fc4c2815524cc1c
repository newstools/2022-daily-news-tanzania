Kuwait's Defence Minister Sheikh Hamad Jaber Al Ali Al Sabah survived a vote of no confidence in parliament on Wednesday over a number of decisions, including one to allow women to serve in combat roles. After discussing the motion against the minister, 23 members of parliament voted against the motion, while 18 voted in favour. Four members of parliament – two for and two against – spoke on Wednesday on the motion that was brought against Sheikh Hamad last week.
Representatives Shuaib Al Muwaziri and Hamdan Al Azmi spoke as supporters of the request for a vote of no confidence, while Dr Abdullah Al Tariji and Dr Khaled Al Enezi spoke against the motion. Mr Al Muwaizri said there was "clear and open corruption" and the questioning of Sheikh Hamad last week was not personal. “The minister’s management is bad and the continuation of this negative performance is unacceptable,” Mr Al Muwaizri told parliament. Kuwait’s government has also referred two senior military officers for prosecution in a major corruption case related to the purchase of Eurofighter Typhoon combat planes. Source:thenationalnews
