MAIZE farmers in the Rukwa region have been urged to sell their crops through Warehouse Receipt System (WRS) as it is the best system because it incorporates other crops. The remark was made recently by Sumbawanga District Commissioner, Sebastian Waryuba while opening two days of training meant to build capacity on the preparation of requisite reports to Agriculture and Marketing Cooperative Societies (AMCOS). The DC further elaborated that the WRS is a move to ensure that crops are sold via the system which aims sat boost the agricultural sector and is in line with the government's pledges to farmers. "Equally this is one of the government initiatives aimed at making farmers benefit from agricultural activities and address challenges that have been afflicting farmers for years....for this WRS to be efficient, we need to have cooperative society unions of the crop under the system" noted the DC. Earlier on welcoming note the Ufipa Cooperative Union (UCU) chairman, Adabeth Nguyani revealed that farmers in the region have earned 2.0bn/- after selling   5,200 tonnes of maize this maize purchasing season. Additionally, Nguyani further noted that UCU has borrowed over 1.0bn/- from financial institutions emphasising that the loan will enable 35 primary cooperative societies to facilitate procurement of agricultural inputs including fertilizers as well as modern seeds.
