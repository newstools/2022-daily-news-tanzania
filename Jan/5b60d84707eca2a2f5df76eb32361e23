Vodacom Tanzania Plc will dish out a total of 3.4bn/- in dividend to its M-Pesa customers who have used the services in the third quarter of the company’s financial year. Vodacom’s M-Commerce Director Mr Epimack Mbeteni said in Dar es Salaam over the weekend that the profit will be paid to all individual customers, retail agents and other M-Pesa business partners who will receive payment based on transactions made via their mobile wallets. “Our mobile money service, M-Pesa, continues to be a remarkable success story, delivering significant social and financial value to Tanzanians. We have seen substantial growth on the M-Pesa platform with more customers, agents, merchants and institutions transacting around 100bn/- each day. In line with regulations of the Bank of Tanzania (BoT), interest earned from the deposit is periodically shared with the customers. Today we are happy to share a dividend of 3.4bn/-with our over eight million customers who used our M-Pesa services in the said quarter,” he said. Vodacom has over 12.6 million customers on its M-Pesa platform commanding a market share of 38 per cent according to recent Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA) statistics. The company has so far paid out a total of 171bn/- as interest payout since July 2015 when BoT enacted the regulation. Mr Mbeteni added that the profit share per customer is calculated as per the BoT circular and will depend on, among other things, the level of activity they would have had on M-Pesa for the said period. “We have started distributing the money to customer M-Pesa wallets. Upon receiving the disbursed amount, M-Pesa customers can redeem the interest via cash withdrawal, airtime or bundle purchases or even transact the bonus to pay bills or purchase products,” he added.
