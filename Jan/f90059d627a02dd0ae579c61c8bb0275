Emirates airline will continue flights to the US after the launch of 5G networks was delayed at US airports, after concerns the signals could affect the planes's instruments. Emirates said Thursday it will lift a suspension of flights to several US destinations in a "temporary reprieve" after the launch of 5G networks was delayed near American airports over safety fears. Flights to six destinations will resume Friday, and on Saturday services to Boston, Houston and San Francisco will return to Boeing 777 planes after having been changed to Airbus A380s, the Dubai-based carrier said in a statement. The airline announced flight suspensions on Tuesday over concerns that the 5G mobile networks launched by AT&T and Verizon could interfere with altimeters, which measure altitude. The telecom firms agreed to delay 5G services around airports as the super-fast networks opened without major disruption on Wednesday.
