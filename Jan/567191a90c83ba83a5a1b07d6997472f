THE National Assembly was forced on Friday to reschedule its Jan. 2022 calendar to next month following the resignation of Speaker Job Ndugai. The Parliament Clerk, Nenelwa Mwihambi announced in a public statement that all parliamentary committees that were scheduled to begin proceedings on Jan. 10 and Jan. 17 have been pushed to Feb. 1,. Ndugai tendered his resignation on Thursday, the first in the country’s history attributing the decision to his personal grounds in line with protecting the vast interest of the nation, the government and his political party, Chama cha Mapinduzi. According to the Constitution, the National Assembly can only seat where there is a Speaker. In the event the Speaker resigns, the first task ahead of the Members of Parliament (MPs) is to elect a new Speaker.
