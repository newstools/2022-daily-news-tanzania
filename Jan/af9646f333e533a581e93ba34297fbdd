The oil-rich capital of the United Arab Emirates has made booster doses mandatory for entry as the Gulf nation battles a renewed surge of infections driven by the omicron variant. Starting this week, people traveling to Abu Dhabi will need to have booster doses to enter unless exempted by the authorities. The latest move comes just weeks after the emirate said vaccinated individuals will require a green status on a mobile health app to enter. That green status will now only appear following a booster dose. It wasn’t immediately clear if the latest requirement also applies to neighboring Dubai, which has generally had fewer restrictions through the pandemic. Cases have surged in the UAE since the omicron variant was first reported in December. The country reported 2,792 cases on Tuesday. Before the new variant emerged, the country had managed to keep cases under control for most of this year. De facto ruler Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan declared the crisis over in October as infections fell below 100 a day for the first time since the pandemic began.
