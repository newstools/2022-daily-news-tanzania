PERMANENT Secretary, Office of the First Vice President, Dr Omar Dadi Shajak has urged employees to understand job descriptions so that they can leave a legacy of their performance when they retire. Shajak gave the advice during a farewell party of two security staff of the Office of the First Vice President, Mr Ali Omar Ali and Mr Silima Khamis Machano held at the conference hall at the office, Migombani Street. He said that every employee should do the best while they still  working  to leave behind a legacy because it is important for executives and other employees successors to emulate the good things  left by the retirees including integrity, and accountability. “Retirement from a job is not the end of life. Life must go on because, as citizens, your contribution to the country’s development is still important,” Dr Sharjak said urging the retired staff to engage in other income generating activities. Ms Fatma Mohamed, on behalf of the staff of the Office of the First Vice President, said employees need to encourage team work, patience , cooperation and love among  themselves. The office Director of Operations and Personnel Mr Juma Ali Simai said the farewell for the retired employees is a legal as per regulation which directs preparing the retirees by providing them with special training before retirement and bidding farewell to retirees where necessary. Mr Ali Omar Ali, on behalf of his colleague, thanked the employees and leaders in the Office of the First Vice President, and the Government as a whole for their care and recognition until retirement, and also for organizing a farewell party.
