In a bizarre turn of events, US tech billionaire Elon Musk appears to have challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to a one-on-one fight, suggesting that the winner decide the fate of Ukraine. Ukrainian politicians so far have welcomed the offer, which may have been made tongue-in-cheek. Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko, himself a former boxer, replied with three strong arm emojis. The Russian president is yet to respond. Musk has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine throughout the invasion. Earlier this month one of the companies owned by the California-based tech entrepreneur, Starlink, supplied Ukraine with a number of satellite dishes intended to protect internet access in the country.
