MEMBERS of the media fraternity have been urged to do more in ensuring that the rights of People with Disabilities (PWDs) are observed. This reminder was made by the State Minister, First Vice-President’s Office (HIV/AIDS, PWDs, Environment) Dr Saada Mkuya Salum at the ‘Inclusive Media Project-Disability Reporting Training’ held here on Monday. Dr Mkuya said it was imperative for media to support the government’s efforts in ensuring people with disabilities fully enjoy what they deserve as human being without any discrimination. “Write good stories about PWDs but also expose challenges facing them to help government take action to address the problems,” Ms Salum said, adding that the government has been taking different measures to promote the rights of PWDs She said that the government through her ministry is initiating better laws, policy, and guidelines that need to be observed particularly in the construction industry, so that infrastructures are friendly to the PWDs in the country. “It is unfortunate that despite the presence of the guidelines, implementation remains a challenge. Media and journalists are in a better position to advocate for change and respect for the PWDs. I urge you to do the work and you may be awarded,” Dr Mkuya said as she thanked the ‘Internews’ for organising and facilitating the training. According to Ms Jackie Lidubwi- Internews project lead, the training also conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Liberia, Ivory Coast, and Tanzania aim at enabling journalists to become champions in covering PWDs in an acceptable way, raising their vices, minimizing stereotype and discrimination. Mr Shaban Maganga- Internews Tanzania Programme Coordinator informed participants (Journalists) that his organisation has been organising different trainings in different countries so that ethics and regulations are observed while covering news/ articles.
