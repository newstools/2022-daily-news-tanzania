THE Parliamentary Committee on AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB), Drugs and Non-Communicable Diseases, has called on the government to intensify efforts in the fight against various diseases in mining areas. The Committee chairperson, Ms Fatma Foutiq, made the call earlier this week when the members toured Geita region. According to Foutiq, preliminary research reveals that many people affected with TB are coming from the Lake zone, especially in neighborhoods where mining activities are being carried out. She said TB appeared to be chronic in such areas, affecting a large number of artisanal and small scale miners who work without taking health precautionary measures. According to her poor working environment expose them to dusts from mining and extractive activities, becoming the major TB causative agent. She added that HIV / AIDS infection rate is also high in such areas due to the fact that the places attract a huge number of people from different areas. Foutiq directed the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Minerals to collaborate in working on the problem to save lives.
