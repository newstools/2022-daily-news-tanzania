RESIDENTS of Sumbawanga District Council will breathe a sigh of relief as construction of the 107 kilometres strategic road project stretching from the council to Kasanga port terminal has reached 99 per cent. Speaking here during the 44 Regional Road Board (RRB) meeting, Rukwa Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr Joseph Mkirikiti said the completion of the strategic highway project stretching from Sumbawanga town to Kasanga Terminal via Matai Township would spur up new investment opportunities to benefit the surrounding communities and economy. A passenger’s driver for a bus plying between Sumbawanga and Kasanga Terminal, Mr Mohamed Hanis said riding on a rough road in those days was like hell on earth. “The improvement in transport infrastructures in the region helps us to boost our income,” he said. While a petty trader based in Kasanga Port terminal, John Shemboka said, “I did expect this carriageway to be in this at tarmac level that I witness today... Indeed I'm thrilled it is like a miracle" he added. Mariam John and Siwajibu Swedish from Kalambo District said previously one could see only one passenger's bus but currently one can witness seven passengers’ buses riding to and from every day.
