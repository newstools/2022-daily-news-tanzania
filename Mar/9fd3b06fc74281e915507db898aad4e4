GEITA Regional Commissioner Rosemary Senyamule has called on the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) to devise alternative mechanisms that will raise efficiency in tax collection. Ms Senyamule made the appeal here over the weekend when speaking to Geita TRA officers on the regional tax collection review debate. She said despite the law enforcement, TRA has to apply new skills and knowledge that will inspire business people to voluntarily pay taxes. “Let us go and find alternative ways to make sure that taxes are paid willingly, it may not be very voluntary, but if the willingness is there, then we can step ahead of our annual collections. “By saying this, hopefully, you will change, so that this year’s revenue collection can reach up to 100 per cent of our current goal. I hope you will invest in education, influence and raise awareness,” she stressed. She insisted “I would like to see the government institutions working co-operatively for us to make our citizens, our businessmen and our taxpayers comfortably invest in our region” TRA Geita Regional Manager, Hashimu Ngoda said, for the financial year 2018/19, TRA revenue annual target was 51bn/-, where about 66bn/- was collected, making efficiency of 129.5 per cent of the targets. “In 2019/20 TRA targeted 31bn/- but only 29bn/- were collected, equivalent to a 93 per cent efficiency of the annual targets,” he said.
