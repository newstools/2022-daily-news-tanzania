Local contractors have been advised to form one strong association as a platform to address challenges impeding their efforts to thrive as well as the construction sector's contribution to economic growth. This was said here over the weekend by the Chairperson of Contractors Registration Board (CRB) Eng Consolata Ngimbwa at the closing of the two day training on Joint Ventures (JVs) for local contractors. “The challenges you face today could have been solved by forming a strong association to speak to the government and your clients and enable you to move smoothly,” she said. The chairperson said selfishness among local contractors has been an obstacle to forming a strong association because everyone considers himself instead of the entire industry. She also urged them to complete projects within agreed time and standards because the government decided to do its projects by using a force account after realizing that some contractors are lazy. “Days are moving and we witness the rapid establishment of contractors associations and sometimes I ask myself where we have failed I don’t get the proper answer,” she asked. The two days training was part of the regular capacity building programme by the CRB to contractors of all classes on the best way to perform joint ventures projects. She cited one example in Egypt where also there were a lot of contractors associations but after they came to realize that they are helpless they decided to form one strong association and they are moving smoothly. The Deputy Registrar (Research and Development), Eng David Jere said the two days training was attended by 69 contractors of all classes. He said the contractors were from Dar es Salaam, Dodoma, Iringa, Morogoro, Katavi, Mbeya, Mwanza, Singida, Songwe, Tabora, Arusha, Njombe, Kilimanjaro and Rukwa. He said CRB has been organising regular capacity building training for local contractors as a move to enable them to perform big projects like their counterparts from abroad.
