YOUNG Africans have announced a new voting mechanism that enables the club to appropriately elect top officials. This has been termed as the way of creating the good system going towards the club’s election. The Chairman of the club’s Electoral Committee, Malangwe Mchungahela unveiled on Wednesday in Dar es  Salaam that the new voting system to elect top officials is foolproof. Mchungahela said:“We have changed our voting system and now the election will start at the branches, with the position of Chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretary, Assistant Secretary, Treasurer and Four (4) Members, Election of Branches should start on 18/3/2022 until the end of the month.” Adding, the club’s Chief Executive Officer (C.E.O) Senzo Mbatha said the club aims to show how a big club should be "ICONIC" for small clubs. “We are building the next Yanga which will be one of the biggest clubs in Africa in the future. That’s why we have started with real and free change for all our members at home and abroad. We have entered into a good contract with positive relationships named Kilinet, N Card and  We Yanga. “And one of our biggest goals is to have the best modern cards for our members so that they can use them for many more years and that is why Kilinet advised us to make our cards in Sevilla,Spain. “We are happy to work with La liga and Sevilla as our cards which members will start receiving are just the same as those of Sevilla members. Yesterday we received our cards from Spain and soon Kilinet will start publishing names of our registered members," he said.
