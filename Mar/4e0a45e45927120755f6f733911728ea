The country’s famous comedian, Steven Mengere alias ‘Steve Nyerere’ has resigned as Tanzania Music Federation (SMT) spokesperson after being pressured by a section of artistes who claimed that the man was not a right person to hold the post. The flamboyant artist made the decision on Friday claiming that the ongoing discussions about the post were not healthy to the country. “I have resigned to continue with other important work, I don’t mean that this was not an important job,” Steve Nyerere said. The comedian was appointed on March 18, 2022 as the spokesperson of the federation. However, he said despite his resignation he will continue to cooperate with the federation at all times.
