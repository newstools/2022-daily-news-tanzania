ZANZIBAR President Dr Hussein Mwinyi is tomorrow scheduled to officiate at Tanzania Editors Forum’s (TEF) general meeting here. The forum’s sixth general and the first Unguja-hosted meeting is expected to attract over 250 delegates, mostly editors from all regions of Zanzibar and Tanzania Mainland as well as some foreign invitees, TEF Chairman Deodatus Balile told reporters yesterday. “This is going to be a special meeting. The Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar, under President Mwinyi, has accorded us a unique respect. We are very glad,” said the chairman, noting that the ‘Blue economy and mass communication’-themed gathering seeks to widen editors and journalists’ understanding on the concept. Mr Balile said the three-day meeting will deliberate on various issues pertaining to the profession. The economy of media houses; media laws; and media and journalists ethics are among the key issues, which will be discussed. The delegates will as well have the Zanzibar excursion day—on Friday—to sample Zanzibar’s wealth of tourist attractions. “We (journalists) have the role to support the government’s efforts to market the tourism potential. The media is obliged to contribute to the tourism growth in Zanzibar,” Mr Balile argued for the excursion. TEF brings together editors of all media houses in Tanzania with the aim of promoting the profession, defend media freedom, freedom of expression, professional ethics and accelerate social and economic development in the country.
