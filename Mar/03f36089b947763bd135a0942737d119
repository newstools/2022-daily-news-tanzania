Acting Deputy Director of the hospital, Dr Julieth Magandi said on Friday that as plans are underway, some women have shown the readiness in donating their milk for the bank. “We have already done the assessment and the people are ready to donate milk,” she said. Dr Julieth made the revelation at the hospital premises when the Minister of Health, Ummy Mwalimu visited the health facility earlier today.
