TANZANIA Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA) has said the increase in the use of mobile telecommunication services has contributed greatly to the growth of the financial sector in the country. The TCRA Director General, Dr Jabir Bakari said in Dar es Salaam on Tuesday at the World Consumers Right Day that the change of technology has improved the efficiency in the provision of financial services. “The advancement of the digital economy has contributed to major changes with mobile phone users experiencing a lot of things in cyberspace where it is a person's choice to use what is best for him/her,” he said. For example, the number of mobile money users had increased to 35.2 million as of February this year. Further said, he has already negotiated with all telecommunications companies to ensure that students who do innovation related Information and Communication Technology (ICT) via the internet should not be charged any cost. Speaking on consumer rights of communication services, Dr Bakari said TCRA has placed a confidentiality requirement on service providers/operators to ensure and maintain the confidentiality of the content of all communications whether data or any information that the service provider/operator may obtain as a result of serving a customer. A consumer has a right to have access to basic communications services at reasonable prices. It is a fundamental human right to have access to communications services at an affordable price, particularly the basic services like telephone and postal.
