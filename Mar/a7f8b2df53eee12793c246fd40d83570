Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge, the two-times Olympic marathon champion and world record holder, won the Tokyo Marathon in Japan with a time of two hours two minutes and 40 seconds on Sunday. Kipchoge breaks the previous record set in 2017 by fellow countryman Wilson Kipsang of 2:03:58. Kipchoge, who defended his marathon title at Sapporo at the Tokyo Games last year, fell short of his world record mark by just over a minute in his debut Tokyo Marathon. Brigid Kosgei on her part broke at the 35km mark to finish in 2 hours 16 minutes and 2 seconds shattering Israel’s Lonah Chemtai Salpeter's time of 2:17:45. Kipchoge proved to the world that he is still the man to beat after maintaining a pace that saw some of his competitors fall off one by one after the pacemakers dropped. World marathon bronze medalist Amos Kipruto emerged second after clocking his personal best time of 2:03:13, while Ethiopia’s Tamirat Tola finished third in 2:04:14. Kipchoge pulled away from Kipruto at around the 35km mark but was unable to beat the 2:01.39 he clocked at the 2018 Berlin marathon. Ethiopia’s Shura Kitata, who beat Kipchoge to win the 2020 London Marathon, finished fifth. #nation
