TAIFA Stars skipper Mbwana Samatta has joined a list of people going to support the fundraising gala whose proceeds will be channeled to support the national women’s team Twiga Stars as part and parcel of commemorating the International Women’s Day today. Dubbed the Orange Concert, the event is set to unfold at Julius Nyerere International Convention Centre (JNICC) in Dar es Salaam whose guest of honour will be the Minister for Finance and Planning Mwigulu Nchemba. In his remarks yesterday, Samatta lauded the government for coming up with the historic fundraising event specifically to support Twiga Stars saying it will help them to do much better in international games. “I know and value a lot of good works being done by Twiga Stars in sports sector and I unite with my government to fully support the team during the Orange Concert occasion,” he said. He then encouraged all Tanzanians to support president Samia Suluhu Hassan’s efforts to uplift sports in the country saying women teams have been doing well as such, time is here to boost them financially and materially in order to put Tanzania on the global face. On his part, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry for Culture, Arts and Sports Hassan Abbasi said the event solely aims at sourcing funds to help Twiga Stars as one way to entice more women to engage in sports. “As the responsible ministry, we have come up with this idea so that sport stakeholders in the country can come together and contribute for the Twiga Stars,” he said. On her part, National Sports Council (NSC) Acting General Secretary Neema Msitha appreciated the event’s organisers Dada Hood for their remarkable work to uplift status of women in the country.
