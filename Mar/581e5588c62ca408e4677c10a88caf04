ARUSHA District Commissioner, Saidi Mtanda has challenged bodaboda operators in the city to assist the police office in exposing criminals. Launching an office of the Association of Arusha Bodaboda Riders (UBOJA) here midweek, Mr Mtanda said the operators have a noble duty of unmasking criminals, who masquerade as customers. “In the recent past we’ve had cases of unscrupulous riders committing petty and major violent crimes and motorcycles have become a major facilitator in commission of crimes, some are known to you, don’t just sit back, you’ve to report them to the police,” challenged the DC. Such incidences were tarnishing the image of Arusha Bodaboda riders, according to Mr Mtanda, urging them to be vigilant in exposing such rackets. The District Commissioner further observed that armed gangs had infiltrated bodaboda trade and were killing, maiming, kidnapping, raping and robbing innocent people. “I want you to become a model in restoring sanity among other motorcycle riders in the region,” he said. The District Commissioner equally challenged the riders to observe traffic rules and regulations as a way of bringing sanity to the industry and safety to all road users. According to Mr Mtanda, the government will not turn a blind eye on rogue riders vowing to deal with law offenders. In his rejoinder, UBOJA chairperson, Okelo Constantine informed Mr Mtanda that the operators were currently struggling with license fees imposed on them by the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), calling on the government to introduce a waiver on such charges. “A great deal of the operators in the city own motorbikes on contractual terms, therefore we find it difficult to raise daily earnings to accumulate for TRA fees,” explained Mr Costantine. On his part, area MP Mrisho Gambo pledged to support the riders in their endeavors, including securing them soft loans in bolstering their businesses.
