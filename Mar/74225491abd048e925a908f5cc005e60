Members of an anarchist group have occupied a central London property linked to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. The Anarchist Action Network says they are occupying the mansion in Belgrave Square in protest against Russia's invasion of Ukraine and to show "solidarity" with the people of Ukraine and Russian citizens "who never agreed to this madness". The group says the property will serve as a "refugee support, for people of Ukraine and people of all nations and ethnicity". Some of the protesters told the attending press that there is no hot water in the house and no food in the fridges, suggesting the property has not been lived in for a while. They say they do not intend to live or sleep at the property but will occupy it on rotation. Last week, the UK added Deripaska, an industrialist with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, to the list of people it has sanctioned. Deripaska has been sanctioned in the US since April 2018.
