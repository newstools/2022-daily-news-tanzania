THE government has said that preliminary investigations on water pollution in Mara river which killed  fish at Darajani area  in Kirumi  Tarime district  was caused by high level of grease and oil as well as  lack of oxygen. Speaking to journalists here over the weekend, Lake Victoria Basin Water Board Director, Mr Renatus Shinhu said oxygen was below the acceptable level at the affected area. He said his board received reports of water pollution on March 8 this year which showered that the contamination affected five villages of Kwibuse, Marasibora, Ketasakwa and Ryamisanga. He said they carried out preliminary investigations immediately by involving other government institutions such as the Government Chemist Laboratory Authority, National Environmental Management Council (NEMC), Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute (TAFIRI) and representatives from both Rorya district commissioner’s and Mara regional commissioner’s offices. Mr Shinhu said the board visited the area on March 8 this year and took water samples for testing to find out the water quality in the affected area. "We have found that there was high level of oil and grease, which reduced oxygen in the water, thus affecting biodiversity including fish … this incident serves as a lesson to us and the people living surrounding Mara River to have a culture of protecting water sources using the villages’ water communities," he said. Regarding the colour of the water that turned to blackish he said a forensic examination is underway to determine what caused that situation, as it happened for the first time in history. "After conducting our primary investigation, we will continue with a forensic examination in the area to establish/ determine the type of fuel and where was it from," he said He added that, according to the 11th March laboratory findings the amount of oxygen in water was on increase and also the amount of fuel level has decreased.
