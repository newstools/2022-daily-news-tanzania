IT never stops raining for Tanzania Prisons as they have not yet shrugged off the win-less demon as it continues to haunt them in both home and away Premier League matches. The once Mbeya region giants recorded their 11th defeat of the season after going down 2-1 to Biashara United at CCM Kirumba Stadium in Mwanza on Tuesday as misery continued to pile up. The slump has made Prisons to lead teams which recorded the highest number of defeats followed by Mbeya Kwanza and Ruvu Shooting each with eight loses in the campaign. However, both Tanzania Prisons and Mbeya Kwanza are having tough moments in the progressing league as they accommodate the last two slots on the table, hence if this continues, the Green City may see the two sides demoted to the Championship League . At a post-match briefing, Tanzania Prison's Assistant Coach Shaaban Kazumba repelled fears of possible relegation saying they have at least 12 matches to steer them to safety. "Indeed our trend is not convincing as we are losing many matches, but that is not a reason to judge us we are heading to the exit door. We have almost 12 encounters which we will work hard to win and go up from the bottom of the log," he said. The team's Head Coach Patrick Odhiambo is going through hard times at Tanzania Prisons and he got punished by his former employer Biashara United as he seems not to have found the winning formula. His counterpart for Biashara United Vivier Bahati was full of praise after picking comfortable 3 points which saw his side moving to the 13th place on the table with 19 points in the bag. "It was a tough match as you saw but the most important thing is the victory we have managed to get. We now focus on the next match with full confidence to win and continue to climb up the league ladders," Bahati noted. Mbeya region is the second after Dar es Salaam in having many league representatives (three) as the latter have four envoys with all looking committed to stay put in the contest next season.
