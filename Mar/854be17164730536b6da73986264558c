Importers in the country have been urged to adhere to standards put by the Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) to avoid incurring losses once low quality goods are seized and destroyed as well as turning the country into a dumping place of substandard goods. The TBS Inspector, Venance Colman made the plea during the 23rd Buildexpo Africa 2022 held in Dar es Salaam over the weekend. The exhibition attracted exhibitors from more than 30 countries and visitors from all over East and Central Africa, thus giving exhibitors an excellent opportunity to explore several countries at one time. Mr Colman said during the exhibition that most of the participants were foreigners who provided education to importers on the need to abide by standards. “Most of the participants of the Buildexpo were foreigners and thus the education provided by TBS focused on the importation procedures. We urged to ensure that imported goods meet the required standards,” he said. He said most of the participants inquired from TBS about the imports procedures before embarking on the business. He said some of the benefits of importing goods that meet the TBS standards are to avoid incurring losses and turning the country into a damping place of low quality goods. He said once the low quality goods are seized they are destroyed and importers get penalised thus incurring huge losses. One of the participants at the Buildexpo 2022, Yasin Yakhim commended TBS for using the exhibition to provide education on importation procedures to be observed before embarking into the business.
