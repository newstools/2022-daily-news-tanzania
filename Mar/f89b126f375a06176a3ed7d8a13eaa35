MINISTER of State, Office of the Prime Minister, Labor, Youth, Employment and the Disabled, Prof Joyce Ndalichako challenged the Public Service Social Security Fund (PSSSF) board of trustees to review non-performing projects executed by the scheme. Prof Ndalichako, who was inaugurating a nine-member board here last Friday, urged the team not to hesitate to scrap the projects which were proving to be a burden on tax payers’ contributions. “The new board should review stalling projects with a view of doing them away to spare our members the burden of footing for them,” she urged. The Minister further challenged the PSSSF board members to work in unison in realizing the fund’s objectives. She assured the board of a continued support as it seeks to realize its mission of providing high quality social security services using competent, motivated staff and appropriate technology. In his earlier remarks, Deputy Permanent Secretary in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) for Labour, Youth, Employment and the Disabled, Jamal Katundu said they were optimistic that the new formed board of trustees would steer PSSSF into safe waters. “This is a diversified board having all that it takes in improving the social security scheme,” said Prof Katundu. He however appealed to the board of trustees to shy away from engaging in squabbles with the PSSSF management, urging it to adhere to the agent, strategic and resources dependency theories. “I challenge you to have a bucket list of what you’ll all be remembered for,” added Prof Katundu. The Deputy PS also commended the PSSSF management for a well-done job in collecting contributions and payment of terminal benefits to employees of public service in the country. The Public Service Social Security Fund is a social security scheme established by Public Service Social Security Act of 2018.
