Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich says he is planning to sell the club. In a statement on the Premier League club's website, businessman Abramovich said he had made "incredibly difficult decision" which "pains" him. The Russian will not ask "for any loans to be repaid" and said proceeds of the sale would be donated to war victims. Abramovich had said on Saturday he would give "stewardship and care" of Chelsea to its foundation trustees following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
