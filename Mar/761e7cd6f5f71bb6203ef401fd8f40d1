The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has dismissed all the charges against the Chama cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo party (CHADEMA) Chairman, Freeman Mbowe and his three fellows today. The decision was made at the High Court’s Corruption and Economic Crimes Division in Dar es Salaam in where all cases including terrorism conspiracy, financing conspiracy and the participation in meetings that intended to blow up gas stations were all dropped. According to a statement from the Prison Officer, the accusers were not able to appear at the court due to Mr Mbowe falling sick. The case was dropped before Judge Joachim Tiganga who is in charge of the case where by February 18, 2022 he reviewed the evidence of 13 state witnesses and found all the accused with a case to answer.
