ISLES Premier League continues to rage on here with Polisi Zanzibar handing Machomanne a 3-0 blitz at Amaan stadium over the weekend. However, it was an easy win for Polisi despite the victory as they had to wait until the second half to seal the victory after ending the first scoreless. Machomanne defence played brilliantly in the first half, but lost concentration in the second and allowed all three goals behind their net. Midway in the second half, Polisi eventually opened their goal account in the 68th minute through Paulo Costa Simeon. Seven minutes later, Ali Abdallah Ali netted the second goal for Polisi in the 75th minute Polisi scored their third goal in the 83rd minute through Yakub Omar Hamad. At Gombani Stadium in Pemba, Black Sailor and Selem View fought to a 1-1 draw in a fiercely contested game. Selem View who played a cautious game, opened their goal account through Abdulkadir Khamis Mohammed’s own goal. Black Sailor defender fired into his own net in an attempt to block Mbarouk Ali Suleiman’s shot. After scoring the opener, Selem View continued to raid Black Sailors’ goal, but their strikers wasted most of the chances they created. The teams finished the first half with Selem View leading 1-0. Black Sailor came a rejuvenated side in the second half, they constantly raided Selem View’s goal  and their efforts paid them off in the 53rd minute when Faraji Haji Kheri equalised. The Isles Premier League continues today at Amaan Stadium where Kipanga are pitted against Zimamoto and later leaders KMKM will host Taifa Jang’ombe.
